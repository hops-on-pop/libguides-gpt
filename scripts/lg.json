Case 1: \"Write in AMA Style\" is a reference style. This means that the references within the text and the bibliography at the end of the text should follow the guidelines laid out by the AMA Manual of Style. This is frequently used for papers and other writing in classes, and presentations conducted during classes or practice rotations. This guide includes detailed help on creating references in AMA Style. Case 2: \"Write in AMA Style\" as a manuscript style. This means using proper references within the text and bibliography, but also using the stylistic matters laid out in the AMA Manual of Style to format the text. This includes such factors as using headings and capitalizing them appropriately, line spacing, margins, text style issues (such as using \"one\" or \"1\", using AM or a.m. or A.M.), placement of page numbers, preferred font and spacing for graphs, preferred size and shape for tables, etc. This is more frequently called for when publishing writing, submitting to a journal for peer review, or writing materials for presentation or distribution at professional meetings. This guide includes some help on manuscript style, but it is not extensive. Consult the AMA Manual of Style for detailed information on manuscript style."

If used, spell out at the first use, even if the acronym or initialism is well-known. Do not place periods between the letters of an acronym, abbreviation or initialism. State names should always appear as full names in the text of a manuscript. If included in references, use the two-letter abbreviation. Numbers: Numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) should be used in all writing, except when: The number begins the sentence or title Common fractions Ordinals: first through ninth Number spelled out in quotations or titles of works cited. One number may be spelled out, if the sentence requires multiple numbers to be placed next to each other. E.g., \"If 12 16-year-olds had this reaction...\" should be changed to \"If twelve 16-year-olds...\" Time: To indicate a time of day, use AM or PM in small capitals. Conventional 12-hour clock time is preferred. However, 24 hour or military time convention can also be used to convey precise timing when needed, such as when describing drug dosage regimens. Dates: When dates are provided in the text, use numerals for day and year, and write out the month. E.g., April 2, 1990. If using dates in a table, you may use numerals for the month (e.g., 4/2/1990). Measurements: Use SI (Le Syst\u00e8me International d'Uniti\u00e9s) standards for writing measurements. Numbers are always written in plain text, there is a space after the number and prior to the unit, and never a period after the unit (unless it ends a sentence). Do not include commas in longer numbers (e.g. 1600 km, not 1,600 km). The Web/Internet: Use e-mail. Never capitalize the \"e\" unless at the beginning of a sentence. Home page is two words. The Internet or Net is a proper noun and should be capitalized. Web (as in World Wide Web) is also capitalized. Web page, Web site, and Web ring are two words. Most other compound words starting with \"web\" are one word and spelled lowercase: webmaster, webcast, webcam, etc."

Where: Once you identify the Who, When, and What, the rest of the information provided to complete the reference falls under \"Where.\"\u00a0 This portion of the reference sees variations in information included based on source type.\u00a0 Essentially, it will provide information as to where the reader can retrieve the source.\u00a0 Where can fall under 2 broad categories: works part of a great whole and stand-alone sources. Visit the individual Reference Type pages to see further formatting and examples for your source type."

The experts will then focus on the sections included in all student papers: title page, text, and reference list, with a brief discussion of tables and figures as well. They will walk through the elements needed for each section and then systematically address any needs for different typeface, line spacing, and alignment within those sections\u2014for example, how those factors affect the format of headings, section labels, block quotations, and table and figure labels. The session will conclude with final steps for organizing papers and strengthening their overall quality and presentation.

Maintained and operated by the Integrated Document Delivery (IDD) department, ARES differs from Blackboard as it is supported by USC Libraries staff to manage physical and electronic reserve requests obtainable and available from library resources. Advantages to using ARES: Instructors can create a class, submit requests for readings, and submit requests for USC-owned items and/or their own personally owned books to be placed on reserve. Online course readings and other material can be easily accessed on one site. Class(es) and course content can be reinstated or \"cloned\" from one semester to another. Requests for course material can be submitted online, pulled from USC Libraries' collection, or processed through interlibrary loan (articles and chapters only) upon instructor request. Online course material accessible 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Instructors can upload their own material such as the class syllabus, practice exams, or links to USC electronic databases or other online resources. USC Libraries' staff available to troubleshoot broken links to e-resources, PDFs, or webpages.

Electronic reserve requests submitted by the instructor as a photocopy to be scanned and posted\u00a0will be processed within 2 to 5 working days. Extra time should be anticipated for article requests from items that must be pulled from USC Libraries shelves or obtained through interlibrary loan. Please note that if requests do not conform to Copyright Guidelines & Rules , posting of the material may be delayed. Electronic reserve items uploaded by the instructor, including articles and/or book chapters in PDF format, Word Documents, or syllabi,\u00a0must first be reviewed by ARES staff to ensure that the material posted conforms to our Copyright Guidelines & Rules and is accessible through ARES. Please note: entire copies of course readers cannot be scanned and posted on electronic reserves. Instructors can check the status of a request logging into ARES, clicking on their course, and viewing the far-right column under \"Status\". \u00a0Statuses include: Awaiting Reserves Processing . \u00a0Request has been submitted and is pending review by staff. Awaiting Supply by Instructor .\u00a0Request has been submitted and is pending receipt by ARES staff. \u00a0This usually refers to requests that need to be scanned from paper copies supplied by the instructor.

Submitting both requests and paper copies to be scanned well ahead of the reading date is strongly recommended. Submitting Physical Reserves Requests As with electronic reserves, we also experience a high volume of physical reserve requests at the beginning of each semester so please note the following information as you plan your needs for course reserves. Items eligible for reserve included books owned by USC Libraries, course readers, and audio-visual materials owned by USC Libraries. \u00a0Books obtained through interlibrary loan cannot be placed on reserve. An instructor can submit their own personal copy to be placed on reserve or request for USC-owned material to be placed on reserve. Please keep in mind that personal\u00a0books/DVDs are used by your students and normal wear and tear may occur. USC Libraries assumes no liability for damage to personal items placed on reserve. Items not owned by USC but submitted as a request to purchase (see below) require extra time to process as these requests must first be reviewed by a librarian. Please note: requests to purchase an item for reserves can be cancelled at USC Libraries' discretion. Instructors can check the status of a request logging into ARES, clicking on their course, and viewing the far-right column under \"Status\". \u00a0Statuses include: Awaiting Reserves Processing . \u00a0Request has been submitted and is pending review by staff. Awaiting Supply by Instructor .\u00a0Request has been submitted and is pending receipt by ARES staff. \u00a0This usually refers to personal book copies supplied by the instructor. Please note : personal book copies will be returned, usually by campus mail, at the end of the semester unless requested otherwise. Awaiting Acquisitions Fulfillment . This status refers to requests is not owned by USC Libraries and has been routed to a USC librarian who manages these purchases and is under review or in process. Awaiting Recall Processing. Request is in use by another patron and has been recalled by ARES staff. \u00a0The other patron has 14 days to return the item which will then be processed upon receipt. In Stacks Searching. Item is currently being searched on USC Libraries' shelves for reserves processing. Item Available at Reserve Desk . \u00a0Request has been processed and is accessible from the assigned library. First Day to Submit Requests for a new semester The first day to submit requests for Fall, Spring, and Summer classes depends on the following schedule: Fall: Last Friday in March Spring: Last Friday in October of the previous year Summer:\u00a0 Last Friday in February For example, the first day to submit a request for Spring 2020\u00a0will be Oct. 25, 2019.\u00a0 The first day to submit a request for Fall 2019\u00a0will be March 29, 2019.\u00a0 You will not be able to add requests or classes for future\u00a0semesters\u00a0if\u00a0the schedule above is not active.\u00a0 For example, a Fall 2020\u00a0class or request can not be added on Ares since the first day to submit a request is March 27, 2020. Request to Purchase a book/DVD for Reserves If your reserves request for a book or DVD is not currently owned by any USC Libraries, you may submit it to be considered for purchase to be added to our collection. It will then be\u00a0placed on reserves upon receipt.\u00a0The request must be first entered into ARES with the option Please consider this for purchase selected on the form.\u00a0 The request to purchase will then be reviewed and forwarded to a librarian.\u00a0 Please note that many factors are involved in purchasing an item\u00a0for reserve such as availability, cost, and subject.\u00a0 The librarian will ultimately decide whether or not to purchase the item and the instructor will be notified, via e-mail, regarding the decision and timetable for its availability.\u00a0 Please note that textbooks do not qualify for purchase since the libraries do not purchase textbooks for it's library collection.\u00a0 If a book/DVD is approved it will first be cataloged and then placed on reserve for the semester assigned.\u00a0 At the end of the semester the item will be integrated into the library's collection. In order to submit a request-to-purchase in a timely matter (particularly orders coming from abroad)\u00a0please note the following timetable: Fall Semester - please submit request-to-purchase by July 15th Spring Semester - please submit\u00a0request-to-purchase by\u00a0December 1st Summer Semester - please submit request-to-purchase by April 1st Reserve requests for purchase need to be allotted sufficient time\u00a0to process, purchase, catalog, and added to the reserve shelf.\u00a0 All\u00a0efforts will be made to purchase\u00a0requested items, but the above timeline is strongly suggested.\u00a0 If you have any questions please contact IDD at idd@usc.edu . Streaming Media Requests Streaming requests for movies and documentaries are now\u00a0available through ARES by submitting requests through\u00a0the Streaming Video (if available) icon.\u00a0 If USC owns streaming rights a link will be posted on the ARES record for students to stream.

IDD's copyright statement: \"The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be \"used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research\". If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of \"fair use\", that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.\" For additional information please see the U.S. Copyright Law of the United states . The following outlines our copyright policies regarding materials placed on reserve. In order to operate within the guidelines of \"fair use\" while striving to provide access to research materials, IDD's copyright policies for the following reserves requests are as follows: Physical Materials Physical items such as books or DVDs placed on reserve do not need any form of copyright or publisher authorization. \u00a0To place a physical item on reserve, you will need to submit the request in ARES which then routed to the designated reserve desk. USC-owned material will be pulled from the shelves after a request for the physical reserve is placed in ARES. An instructor can submit their own personal copy to be placed on reserve or request for USC-owned material to be placed on reserve. Please keep in mind that personal\u00a0books/DVDs are used by your students and normal wear and tear may occur. USC Libraries assumes no liability for damage to personal items placed on reserve. If you are dropping off a physical item to be placed on reserve, please print and fill out the following Drop-off form and include it with the item: Request to Purchase Material Please note that if neither a personal copy is provided or if the book/DVD is not owned by USC, you can still place the request\u00a0and select the option to be considered for purchase and added to the USC library collection.\u00a0 Please note, textbooks do not qualify for purchase since updated\u00a0book editions are constantly being published.\u00a0 Please see Request to Purchase a book/DVD for Reserves under ARES Deadlines for more information. Articles and Book Chapters In addition to placing physical books on reserve, ARES processes and posts articles and chapters from books electronically.\u00a0 You can submit your own photocopies* for scanning at the Leavey Library circulation desk.\u00a0 Any photocopies submitted must include the title and copyright page information of either the book from which it was copied or the journal from which the article is found.\u00a0 You can find this information on the reverse of the title page on the book or on the publication information of the journal article. \u00a0Posting of the materials will be delayed if the copyright statement is not included. Our copyright guidelines for article and book chapter requests are as follows: Article: no more than two articles from a single issue of a periodical or journal can be posted Book Chapters: no more then two chapters from a single work or 15% from the book (whichever is less) Please note that we cannot scan an entire book or other work, nor can we post an electronic copy of an entire work that may be uploaded to ARES. \u00a0We can, however, post links to full-text works that are available through USC Libraries e-resources or on the internet. ARES allows the instructor to submit reserve requests without submitting copies of journal articles or book chapters.\u00a0 If you would like for the library staff to provide the article/chapter in question please choose the \"Pull from Shelf\" option when submitting a request in ARES.\u00a0 Please note that the \"Pull from Shelf' option places the responsibility on Library staff to obtain the assigned material, whether from the libraries collection or Interlibrary Loan, and the copyright information. *Please note that photocopies will not be returned unless specifically requested. Other Material that can be posted on Ares without needing copyright information are: syllabi sample tests sample test answers answer key to questions If you are not sure if copyright information is needed please contact the IDD office at idd@usc.edu or (213) 740-4020."

Additionally, there are three main types of publications: Scholarly sources are\u00a0intended for academic use with a\u00a0specialized vocabulary and extensive citations; they\u00a0 are often peer-reviewed.\u00a0Scholarly sources help answer the \"so what?\" questions\u00a0and make connections between variables (or issues). Popular sources are intended for the general public and are typically written to entertain,\u00a0inform or persuade. Popular sources help you answer \"who, what, where, and when\" questions. Popular sources range from research-oriented to propaganda-focused. Trade publications share general news, trends, and opinions\u00a0in a certain industry;\u00a0they are not considered scholarly, because, although generally written by experts,\u00a0they do not focus on\u00a0advanced research\u00a0and are not peer-reviewed.

While you are Reading: Keep in mind your research question Focus on the information in the article\u00a0relevant to your question (feel free to skim over other parts) Question everything you read - not everything is 100% true\u00a0or performed effectively Think critically about what you read and seek to build your own arguments Read out of order! This isn't a mystery novel or movie, you want to start with the spoiler Use any keywords printed by the journals as further clues about the article Look up words you don't know How to Take Notes on the Article Try different ways, but use the one that fits you best. Below are some suggestions: Print\u00a0the article\u00a0and highlight, circle\u00a0and otherwise mark\u00a0while you read (for a PDF, you can use the highlight text feature\u00a0in\u00a0Adobe Reader) Take notes on the sections, for example in the margins (Adobe Reader offers pop-up sticky notes ) Highlight only very important quotes or terms - or highlight potential quotes in a different color Summarize the main or key points Reflect on what you have read -\u00a0draw your own conclusions . As you read\u00a0jot down questions that come to mind. These may be answered later on in the article or you may have found\u00a0something that the authors did not consider. Here are a few\u00a0questions that might be helpful: Have I taken time to understand all the terminology? Am I spending too much time on the less important parts of this article? Do I have any reason to question the credibility of this research? What specific problem does the research address and why is it important? How do these results relate to my research interests or to other works which I have read?"

What is your research question? When you select an article to read for a project or class, focus on your topic.\u00a0Look for information in the article that is relevant to your research question. Read the abstract first as it covers basics of the article. Questions to consider: What is this article about? What is the working hypothesis or thesis? Is this\u00a0related to my question or area of research? Second: Read the introduction and discussion/conclusion. These sections offer the main argument and hypothesis of the article.\u00a0Questions to consider for the introduction: What do we already know about this topic and what is left to discover? What have other people done in regards to this topic? How is this research unique? Will this tell me anything new related to my research question? Questions\u00a0for the discussion and conclusion: What does the study mean and why is it important? What are the weaknesses in their argument? Is the conclusion valid? Next: Read about the Methods/Methodology. If what you've read addresses your research question, this should be your next section.\u00a0Questions to consider: How did the author do the research?\u00a0Is it a qualitative or quantitative project? What data are the study based on? Could I repeat their work?\u00a0Is all the information present in order to repeat it? Finally: Read the Results and Analysis. Now read the details of\u00a0this\u00a0research. What did the researchers learn? If graphs and statistics are confusing, focus on the explanations around them. Questions to consider: What did the author find and how did they find it? Are the results presented in a factual and unbiased way? Does their analysis agree with the data presented? Is all the data present? What conclusions do you formulate from this data? (And does it match with the Author's conclusions?) Review the References (anytime): These\u00a0give\u00a0credit to other scientists and researchers and show\u00a0you the basis the authors used to develop their research. \u00a0The\u00a0list of references, or works cited, should include all of the materials the authors used in the article. The references list can be a good way to identify additional sources of information on the topic. Questions to ask: What other articles should I read? What other authors are respected in this field? What other research should I\u00a0explore?"

Methodology / Materials and Methods (How) Find the\u00a0details of how the study was performed in this section. There\u00a0should be\u00a0enough specifics so that you could repeat the study if you wanted. Results (What happened) This section includes the findings from the study. Look for the\u00a0data and statistical results in the form of tables, charts, and graphs. Some papers include an analysis here. Discussion / Analysis (What it means) This section\u00a0should tell you what the authors felt was significant about their results. The authors analyze their data and describe what they believe it means. Conclusion (What was learned) Here the authors offer their final thoughts\u00a0and conclusions and may include: how the study addressed their hypothesis, how it contributes\u00a0to the field, the strengths and weaknesses of the study, and recommendations for future research.

Eligibility criteria is # 8 on the PRISMA-P Checklist: Specify the study characteristics (such as PICO, study design, setting, time frame) and report characteristics (such as years considered, language, publication status) to be used as criteria for eligibility for the review. Eligibility Criteria (define inclusion and exclusion criteria for each) Criteria Example Disease or condition Define and\u00a0use explicit criteria for establishing their presence or absence. Population Determined by factors such as age, sex, race, educational status or the presence of a particular condition. Setting May focus on a particular setting, such as a community, hospital, nursing home, chronic care institution, or outpatient setting. Intervention Include interventions of interest and exclude any others. Consider\u00a0what is delivered, who delivers it, how it is delivered, where it is delivered, when and how much is delivered, and whether the intervention can be adapted or tailored. Comparison Alternatives against which the main intervention will be compared (e.g. another intervention, non-exposed control group, or placebo). Outcomes Reporting of outcomes should rarely determine study eligibility for a review.\u00a0However, in some circumstances, the measurement of certain outcomes may be a study eligibility criterion (e.g. when addressing the potential for an intervention to prevent a particular outcome or a specific purpose of an intervention that can be used in the same population for different purposes) Study Design May include specific study designs and exclude others based on designs that best answer the research question Publication Type Inclusion of both published peer-reviewed literature and unpublished studies and grey literature is recommended to decrease bias. Publication Date Best practice is to not limit by date, but date ranges may be applied when updating a systematic review or when specific to an intervention or therapy. Publication Language Including studies in any language is recommended to reduce bias. If necessary (due to lack of funds/resources), limit to languages that can be read by the review team. It is common to amend protocols after the review has started.\u00a0 Common reasons include extending the period of search to include older and newer studies, broadening eligibility criteria, and adding new analyses suggested by the primary analysis. Researchers should not modify the protocol based on knowledge of the results of analyses."

            "box_content": "An SR search strategy must be broad enough to capture all relevant literature. A well-formulated PICO question will help you to identify the main concepts for your search strategy. In most cases: NOT all\u00a0PICO elements should be used in the search. Include P (population or problem). Include I (intervention). Include C only for direct comparisons of two specific interventions. Outcomes are usually NOT recommended to include in your search. In most databases, you are\u00a0searching the title, abstract, keywords and other citation data. You are not searching the full-text of the articles. Example 1: What are the effects of exercise and motor interventions on physical activity and motor outcomes during and after medical intervention on children and adolescents with Acute\u00a0Lymphoblastic Leukemia? PICO Example Include in search? P (population) Children/Adolescents Yes P (problem) Acute\u00a0Lymphoblastic Leukemia Yes I Exercise and motor interventions in addition to medical intervention Yes C Medical intervention without exercise and motor interventions No O Physical activity and motor outcomes No Combine with Boolean Children AND Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia AND Exercise In this example, we can combine P (population) AND P (problem) AND I (intervention) with the Boolean operator AND to find literature with all three concepts. The C (comparison) and O (outcomes) with be analyzed during the review process. Example 2: In patients with large choledocholithiasis, is endoscopic papillary dilation after sphincterotomy favored over sphincterotomy alone? PICO Example Include in search? P Patients with Choledocholithiasis Yes I Endoscopic papillary dilation\u00a0after Sphincterotomy Yes C Sphincterotomy alone Yes O Complete stone removal, adverse events, procedure time No Combine with Boolean Strategy 1: choledocholithiasis AND endoscopic papillary dilation AND\u00a0sphincterotomy Strategy 2: choledocholithiasis AND (endoscopic papillary dilation OR\u00a0sphincterotomy) Strategy 1: Use this strategy if you only want literature that directly compares the intervention and comparison in a single study. Strategy 2: Use this strategy if you want literature that\u00a0directly compares the intervention and comparison in a single study AND studies that examine\u00a0sphincterotomy alone. Combining the intervention with the comparison with OR instead of AND broadens the search to find more literature. The best strategy will depend on your question and the literature available to answer your question. Tip! Develop search strategy on a text document and then copy and paste into databases.

You may be able to use these search strategies to help you start developing your search strategy. Test search results to make sure that relevant articles that you've already identified are included. If your results do not include these articles, you should adjust your search strategy to include additional terms that will retrieve these articles. View the most relevant articles to find additional relevant keywords and controlled vocabulary terms to include in your search. Sort your results by my recent publication date. If there are thousands of articles that are way off topic, try to figure out which terms in your search strategy are retrieving the irrelevant results. Some common issues include: a broad MeSH term exploding to include very irrelevant terms, keywords that are too broad and used too commonly by authors, or unexpected results of truncation. SR teams should search multiple databases. Each database has\u00a0unique controlled vocabulary (when applicable), syntax, and search features. For health sciences SRs, teams usually start by developing a search strategy for PubMed or Ovid Medline and then adjusting\u00a0the search slightly to retrieve comparable results in the remaining databases. Depending on your research question, you may want to simultaneously\u00a0develop the search strategy for at least two databases. For example, simultaneously developing the search strategy for PubMed\u00a0and Embase can help you identify additional relevant keywords and controlled vocabulary terms for each search and reducing the amount of time for revising the strategies for each databases later. Systematic Review Accelerator Polyglot Search MEDLINE Transpose Peer review of SR searches can help identify errors in the search strategy. The peer review of SR searches can greatly\u00a0improve the quality of the search and increase the number of relevant records found for inclusion in reviews, and thus improve\u00a0the overall quality of the SR. Authors can use Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline statement and checklist to review and revise their own strategies. Authors can also ask an experienced searcher, information specialist or librarian to review using the PRESS checklist.

For example, for example if you want to limit your search results by date, you need a good reason to do so and must explain your reasoning in your protocol and manuscript. For a more detailed explanation, see\u00a0ITEM 3: LIMITS AND RESTRICTIONS of the PRISMA-S Explanation and Elaboration document. PRISMA-S (Searching) Extension to the PRISMA Statement for Reporting Literature Searches in Systematic Reviews.

PRISMA-S (Searching) Extension to the PRISMA Statement for Reporting Literature Searches in Systematic Reviews. Truncation or wildcards\u00a0are techniques that broadens your search to include various word endings or word variations or spellings. Typical search symbols include the asterisk (*) , used to replace one or more characters, usually at the end of the word, and the question mark (?), used\u00a0to replace a single character, either\u00a0inside or at the end of the word. For example: toxic* retrieves toxic, toxicity, toxicology, etc. behavio?r\u00a0retrieves behaviour\u00a0and\u00a0behavior p?diatric retrieves pediatric and\u00a0paediatric Tips Each database has unique rules. View the help section of each database for instructions on how to search with truncation and wildcards. In some\u00a0instances, it may be better to use the various versions of the word instead of truncation. It depends on the word, word variations, and specific database. Test your search in each database with and without truncation before making a decision on which strategy is best for your search. Errors in search strategies used in systematic reviews and their effects on information retrieval A phrase search will search for two or more words as an exact phrase. To do so, enclose the words in quotation marks. For example: \"cultural humility.\" If you are considering using phrase searching for an SR search, compare your strategy with and without phrase searching in order to determine if you would miss relevant literature using phrase searching."

The lessons in this book can be applied to writing the background section for a thesis or an original research publication. Literature reviews are now much more challenging to compile today than they used to be. You need a structured approach to handle the sheer volume of published research available. This book will help you formulate a strategy for making decisions about what to include and not include in your review, and produce a reliable and unbiased summary of the existing research. You will learn skills for defining research questions, using search tools and managing citations. This book is part of the American Psychological Association's Concise Guides to Conducting Behavioral, Health, and Social Science Research series. Aimed at undergraduate students in research methods courses or others with a lab or research project, each book describes a key stage in the research process. Collectively, these books provide a solid grounding in research from start to finish. ISBN: 9781433830921 Publication Date: 2019-09-10 From Research to Manuscript by Michael Jay Katz Observations Plus Recipes It has been said that science is the orderly collection of facts about the natural world. Scientists, however, are wary of using the word 'fact. ' 'Fact' has the feeling of absoluteness and universality, whereas scientific observations are neither ab- lute nor universal. For example, 'children have 20 deciduous [baby] teeth' is an observation about the real world, but scientists would not call it a fact. Some children have fewer deciduous teeth, and some have more. Even those children who have exactly 20 deciduous teeth use the full set during only a part of their childhood. When they are babies and t- dlers, children have less than 20 visible teeth, and as they grow older, children begin to loose their deciduous teeth, which are then replaced by permanent teeth. 'Children have 20 deciduous [baby] teeth' is not even a complete scientific sta- ment. For one thing, the statement 'children have 20 deciduous teeth' does not tell us what we mean by 'teeth. ' When we say \"teeth,\" do we mean only those that can seen be with the unaided eye, or do we also include the hidden, unerupted teeth? An observation such as 'children have 20 deciduous teeth' is not a fact, and, by itself, it is not acceptable as a scientific statement until its terms are explained: scientifically, 'children have 20 deciduous teeth' must be accompanied by definitions and qualifiers.

This is a process that emerges in stages, and one which requires critical (but not criticizing) engagement with the evidence, literature, and prior research. The evidence can be an object, an artifact, a historic event, an idea, a theoretical framework, or existing interpretations. Ultimately, you want to be able to pose a research question that you will then investigate in your paper. If you are writing a paper for a course, the initial critical ideas and theoretical frameworks may come from your course readings. Pay attention to footnotes and bibliographies in your readings, because they can help you identify other potential sources of information. As you are thinking about your topic, consider what, if anything, has already been written. If a lot of literature exists on your topic, you will need to narrow your topic down, and decide how to make it interesting for your reader. Regurgitating or synthesizing what has already been said is very unlikely to be exciting both for you and for those who will be reading your wok. If there is little or no literature on your topic, you will need to think how to frame it so as to take advantage of existing theories in the discipline. You may also be able to take advantage of existing scholarship on related topics."

For further elaboration on expository and argumentative papers, as well and for examples of both types of essays, check the book titled The Art of Writing About Art , co-authored by Suzanne Hudson and Nancy Noonan-Morrissey, originally published in 2001. Note that particular disciplines in the arts or humanities may have other specialized types of frameworks for research. Also, remember that a research paper is not \"merely an elaborately footnoted presentation of what a dozen scholars have already said about a topic; it is a thoughtful evaluation of the available evidence , and so is, finally, an expression of what the author [i.e., you] thinks the evidence adds up to.\" [Sylvan Barnet, A Short Guide to Writing About Art (New York: Pearson/Longman, 2005), 238-239.]"

            "box_title": "Distinguishing Primary from Secondary Sources",
            "box_content": "Most research papers in the arts and humanities require use of primary and secondary sources for critical analysis and support of ideas. But what is a primary source and what is a secondary source? Figuring this out can be complicated! What is a Primary Source? The Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) of the American Library Association offers a historical definition of\u00a0 a primary source, to wit: \"primary sources are original records created at the time historical events occurred or well after events in the form of memoirs and oral histories.\" [RUSA, \"Using Primary Sources on the Web,\" accessed January 2014 through http://www.ala.org/rusa/sections/history/resources/pubs/usingprimarysources] Another useful definition is provided by Sylvan Barnet, who describes primary sources as the subject of study, and secondary sources as materials written about the primary sources. [Sylvan Barnet, A Short Guide to Writing About Art (New York: Pearson/Longman, 2005), 240.] Some Examples of Primary Sources Ordinarily, a primary source is thought of as being unique, such as, for example: an object, a letter, a photograph, an art work, a city plan. an archival collection, such as someone's papers or office records. The reality is, however, that not all primary sources are unique. Some have been republished or reproduced multiple times. Here are some examples: a newspaper article that first reported on an event. a creative or theoretical work, such as, for example, the architect Le Corbusier's book Urbanisme , first published during his lifetime in the 1920s, and translated into English fairly soon thereafter as The City of Tomorrow and Its Planning. Editions of this work, both in the original French and in translation, may constitute a primary source, depending on the context in which they are used. The context of your research is very important in defining what are primary and secondary materials. If you are writing a critical course paper on Le Corbusier's ideas for city planning, any translation of his book The City of Tomorrow and Its Planning may be used as a primary source. If, however, you are writing about the development of Le Corbusier's planning thoughts and on the dissemination of his ideas, you will likely have to use a particular edition for your research. Given this more specific historic context of your research, early editions in French and other languages may constitute your primary sources, whereas the later editions may not be as relevant to your study, or might be used as secondary resources. What is a Secondary Source? Regardless of what \"primary\" source is appropriate for the context of your research project, your and others' critical analysis of it are secondary sources. ********************* I highly recommend the USC Libraries Primary Source Guide for information on collections of primary resources and recommendations for evaluating primary sources.

Keep in mind that opinion-based articles, scholarly news, and letters to the editor get published in scholarly journals alongside scholarly articles. Sources that lack references to other sources Data and statistical publications and compilations Primary sources Trade and professional sources Reviews of books, movies, plays, or gallery and art shows, that are not essay-length and that do not inlcude a bibliographic context Non-scholarly materials are legitimate sources for research in the arts and humanities, and should be used in context, just as scholarly sources must be used in context. For example, if you are researching something that happened very recently, you will have to, by necessity, use non-scholarly sources. It takes time for scholarship to be written, reviewed by peers, and published. In addition, there is no guarantee that your particular topic is of interest to other scholars. In such cases, look for scholarly materials in related areas that can provide a critical framework for you to use in analyzing your topic.

            "box_content": "Both scholarly and non-scholarly materials have a place in arts and humanities research. Their use, and even their definition, depends on the context of the research project. Books, conference publications, and academic journal articles, regardless of whether they are print-based or electronic, are common types of scholarly materials, which share the following characteristics: The authors are scholars or researchers with known affiliations and educational/research credentials The authors cite other sources, be they primary or secondary. Many scholarly publications include citations to other sources and bibliographies The language used is either academic or complex, and may include disciplinary or theoretical lingo The publisher is a scholarly press that practices editorial review to ensure that content and context adhere to the expected research parameters The intended audience is composed of researchers, scholars, academics, and other informed or specialized readership. Scholarly and academic journals, which are periodic publications that contain articles, have additional characteristics, such as: An editorial process that is peer reviewed or refereed They publish long articles (essays that are ordinarily at least 10 pages), which may also inlcude an abstract. Scholarly journals often publish essay-length scholarly book reviews, which include citations to other sources Scholarly journals are published relatively infrequently, usually quarterly (once every 3 months),\u00a0semi-annually (twice a year), or annually (once a year). Use the points above to evaluate the scholarly nature of internet sites. It helps if the site's URL ends in .edu. So far, so good. But things are not always clear cut, and here are some complexities to keep in mind: Scholarly materials in art, architecture, theater, cinema, and related fields often include images Images may constitute a large portion of such publications, with text used to illustrate, contextualize, critique, or explicate the visual component There may be fewer citations to other sources, and the bibliographies may be shorter The author may be a creative practitioner, such as, for example, an architect or a playwright The author may be a multi-disciplinary intellectual of a transnational stature, who does not rely on the commonly acceptable scholarly apparatus. For example, works by Roland Barthes, which lack footnotes or bibliographies, are considered scholarly. An essay by Jean Baudrillard about Disneyworld, which appeared in the French daily newspaper Liberation , may also be considered scholarly, given the stature of the author and his importance in the development of a particular theoretical analysis of popular culture."

Often literature review essays are a hybrid: Historic : If the history of publishing sheds important light on the trajectory of scholarship on your topic, it may be useful to organize your essay chronologically by date of publication. Are earlier authors cited in subsequent publications, and if so, which ones? Thematic : Has your topic undergone thematic reinterpretation, and how have the themes been treated by the works under review? \u00a0Is there a methodological context, such as iconographic, sociological, political, religious? Do any of the works offer a methodological reevaluation or re-contextualization of evidence? It may be worthwhile to check the bibliographies of the sources you are reviewing to see who else is cited, and whether there are previous authors and works that are commonly cited by the literature you are reviewing. Theoretical : Has the topic been influenced by theoretical developments, such as structuralism, feminism, historicism? How do the works under review contribute to, amplify on, or reorient the theoretical discourse? It may be worthwhile to check the bibliographies of the sources you are reviewing to see who else is cited, and whether there are previous authors and works that are commonly cited by the literature you are reviewing. A literature review essay written as a chapter of a dissertation ought to be as exhaustive as possible, given the parameters of the dissertation topic. You should be clear in stating the criteria for including and excluding sources. Remember that you are writing an essay. It should have a theme that is reflected in the opening paragraph/section, a body that provides a well constructed critical summary and synthesis of works under review, and a conclusion that may reflect on the current state of scholarship, and, if appropriate, note developing scholarly trends.

            "box_content": "Note: This information is geared toward researchers in the arts and humanities. For a detailed guide on writing book reviews in the social sciences, please check the USC Libraries guide to Writing and Organizing Research in the Social Sciences ,\u00a0authored by Dr. Robert Labaree. When writing an academic book review, start with a bibliographic citation of the book you are reviewing [e.g., author, title, publication information, length]. Adhere to a particular citation style, such as Chicago, MLA, or APA.\u00a0 Put your name at the very end of the book review text. The basic purpose of a book review is to convey and evaluate the following: a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what the book is about; b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the expertise of the author(s); c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how well the book covers its topic(s) and whether it breaks new ground; d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the author\u2019s viewpoint, methodology, or perspective; e.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the appropriateness of the evidence to the topical scope of the book; f.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the intended audience; g.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the arrangement of the book (chapters, illustrations) and the quality of the scholarly apparatus, such as notes and bibliographies. Point \"c. how well the book covers its topics and whether it breaks new ground\" requires your engagement with the book, and can be approached in a variety of ways. The question of whether the book breaks new ground does not necessarily refer to some radical or overarching notion of originality in the author\u2019s argument. A lot of contemporary scholarship in the arts or humanities is not about completely reorienting the discipline, nor is it usually about arguing a thesis that has never been argued before. If an author does that, that's wonderful, and you, as a book reviewer, must look at the validity of the methods that contextualize the author's new argument. It is more likely that the author of a scholarly book will look at the existing evidence with a finer eye for detail, and use that detail to amplify and add to existing scholarship. The author may present new evidence or a new \"reading\" of the existing evidence, in order to refine scholarship and to contribute to current debate. Or the author may approach existing scholarship, events, and prevailing ideas from a more nuanced perspective, thus re-framing the debate within the discipline. The task of the book reviewer is to \u201ctease out\u201d the book\u2019s themes, explain them in the review, and apply a well-argued judgment on the appropriateness of the book\u2019s argument(s) to the existing scholarship in the field. For example, you are reviewing a book on the history of the development of public libraries in nineteenth century America. The book includes a chapter on the role of patronage by affluent women in endowing public libraries in the mid-to-late-1800s. In this chapter, the author argues that the role of women was overlooked in previous scholarship because most of them were widows who made their financial bequests to libraries in the names of their husbands. The author argues that the history of public library patronage, and moreover, of cultural patronage, should be re-read and possibly re-framed given the evidence presented in this chapter. As a book reviewer you will be expected to evaluate this argument and the underlying scholarship. There are two common types of academic book reviews: short summary reviews, which are descriptive, and essay-length critical reviews. Both types are described further down. [Parenthetically, writing an academic/scholarly book review may present an opportunity to get published.]"

Additional information on writing abstracts is available in Dr. Robert Labaree's libguide on organizing research in the social sciences . An abstract is a summary of a paper, a book, or a presentation. As a general rule, the abstract is written by the author of the work. Most abstracts are informative. Abstracts are a required part of graduate theses and dissertations. Abstracts are common in academic and scholarly journal articles, as well as in conference presentations and publications of proceedings. The author, the title, and the abstract are the most immediately visible elements of a work of scholarship that other researchers see as they peruse scholarly databases and publications. These are also the elements that may be indexed by search engines such as Google. Stylistic guidelines : Use active verbs, when possible, and write in complete sentences. Try to imagine yourself in the shoes of a reader who is not familiar with your work, and who might be reading the abstract to decide on the im portance and relevance of your research."

            "box_title": "Choosing a Research Problem / How to Begin",
            "box_content": "Do not assume that identifying a research problem to investigate will be a quick and easy task! You should be thinking about it during the beginning of the course. There are generally three ways you are asked to write about a research problem : 1) your professor provides you with a general topic from which you study a particular aspect; 2) your professor provides you with a list of possible topics to study and you choose a topic from that list; or, 3) your professor leaves it up to you to choose a topic and you only have to obtain permission to write about it before beginning your investigation. Here are some strategies for getting started for each scenario. I.\u00a0 How To Begin:\u00a0 You are given the topic to write about Step 1 : Identify concepts and terms that make up the topic statement . For example, your professor wants the class to focus on the following research problem: \u201cIs the European Union a credible security actor with the capacity to contribute to confronting global terrorism?\" The main concepts in this problem are: European Union, security, global terrorism, credibility [ hint : focus on identifying proper nouns, nouns or noun phrases, and action verbs in the assignment description]. Step 2 : Review related literature to help refine how you will approach examining the topic and finding a way to analyze it . You can begin by doing any or all of the following: reading through background information from materials listed in your course syllabus; searching the USC Libraries Catalog to find a recent book on the topic and, if appropriate, more specialized works about the topic; conducting a preliminary review of the research literature using multidisciplinary databases such as ProQuest or subject-specific databases from the \" By Subject Area \" drop down menu located above the list of databases. Choose the advanced search option in the database and enter into each search box the main concept terms you developed in Step 1. Also consider using their synonyms to retrieve additional relevant records. This will help you refine and frame the scope of the research problem. You will likely need to do this several times before you can finalize how to approach writing about the topic. NOTE : Always review the references from your most relevant research results cited by the authors in footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography to locate related research on your topic. This is a good strategy for identifying important prior research about the topic because titles that are repeatedly cited indicate their significance in laying a foundation for understanding the problem. However, if you\u2019re having trouble at this point locating relevant research literature, ask a librarian for help! ANOTHER NOTE : If you find an article from a database that's particularly helpful, paste it into Google Scholar , placing the title of the article in quotes. If the article record appears, look for a \"cited by\" reference followed by a number [e.g., c ited by 37] just below the record. This link indicates how many times other scholars have subsequently cited that article in their own research since it was first published. This is an effective strategy for identifying more current, related research on your topic. Finding additional cited by references from your original list of cited by references helps you navigate through the literature and, by so doing, understand the evolution of thought around a particular research problem. Step 3 : Since social science research papers are generally designed to encourage you to develop your own ideas and arguments, look for sources that can help broaden, modify, or strengthen your initial thoughts and arguments. For example, if you decide to argue that the European Union is ill prepared to take on responsibilities for broader global security because of the debt crisis in many EU countries, then focus on identifying sources that support as well as refute this position. From the advanced search option in ProQuest , a sample search would use \"European Union\" in one search box, \"global security\" in the second search box, and adding a third search box to include \"debt crisis.\" There are least four appropriate roles your related literature plays in helping you formulate how to begin your analysis : Sources of criticism -- frequently, you'll find yourself reading materials that are relevant to your chosen topic, but you disagree with the author's position. Therefore, one way that you can use a source is to describe the counter-argument, provide evidence from your own review of the literature as to why the prevailing argument is unsatisfactory, and to discuss how your approach is more appropriate based upon your interpretation of the evidence. Sources of new ideas -- while a general goal in writing college research papers in the social sciences is to examine a research problem with some basic idea of what position you'd like to take and on what basis you'd like to defend your position, it is certainly acceptable [and often encouraged] to read the literature and extend, modify, and refine your own position in light of the ideas proposed by others. Just make sure that you cite the sources ! Sources for historical context -- another role your related literature plays in formulating how to begin your analysis is to place issues and events in proper historical context. This can help to demonstrate familiarity with developments in relevant scholarship about your topic, provide a means of comparing historical versus contemporary issues and events, and identifying key people, places, and events that had an important role related to the research problem. Given its archival journal coverage, a good multidisciplnary database to use in this case is JSTOR . Sources of interdisciplinary insight -- an advantage of using databases like ProQuest to begin exploring your topic is that it covers publications from a variety of different disciplines. Another way to formulate how to study the topic is to look at it from different disciplinary perspectives. If the topic concerns immigration reform, for example, ask yourself, how do studies from sociological journals found by searching ProQuest vary in their analysis from those in political science journals. A goal in reviewing related literature is to provide a means of approaching a topic from multiple perspectives rather than the perspective offered from just one discipline. NOTE : Remember to keep careful notes at every stage or utilize a citation management system like EndNotes or RefWorks . You may think you'll remember what you have searched and where you found things, but it\u2019s easy to forget or get confused. Most databases have a search history feature that allows you to go back and see what searches you conducted previously as long as you haven't closed your session. If you start over, that history could be deleted. Step 4 : Assuming you have done an effective job of synthesizing and thinking about the results of your initial search for related literature, you're ready to prepare a detailed outline for your paper that lays the foundation for a more in-depth and focused review of relevant research literature [after consulting with a librarian, if needed!]. How will you know you haven't done an effective job of synthesizing and thinking about the results of our initial search for related literature? A good indication is that you start composing the outline and gaps appear in how you want to approach the study. This indicates the need to gather further background information and analysis about the research problem. II.\u00a0 How To Begin:\u00a0 You are provided a list of possible topics to choose from Step 1 : I know what you\u2019re thinking--which topic on this list will be the easiest to find the most information on? An effective instructor should never include a topic that is so obscure or complex that no research is available to examine and from which to design an effective study. Don't approach a list of possible topics to study from the perspective of trying to identify the path of least resistance; choose a topic that you find interesting in some way, that is controversial and that you have a strong opinion about, that has some personal meaning for you, or relates to your major or a minor. You're going to be working on the topic for quite some time, so choose one that you find interesting and engaging or that motivates you to take a position. Embrace the opportunity to learn something new! Once you\u2019ve settled on a topic of interest from the list, follow Steps 1 - 4 listed above to further develop it into a research paper. NOTE : It\u2019s ok to review related literature to help refine how you will approach analyzing a topic, and then discover that the topic isn\u2019t all that interesting to you. In that case, choose a different topic from the list. Just don\u2019t wait too long to make a switch and, of course, be sure to inform your professor that you are changing your topic. III.\u00a0 How To Begin:\u00a0 Your professor leaves it up to you to choose a topic Step 1 : Under this scenario, the key process is turning an idea or general thought into a topic that can be configured into a research problem. When given an assignment where you choose the research topic, don't begin by thinking about what to write about, but rather, ask yourself the question, \"What do I want to understand or learn about?\" Treat an open-ended research assignment as an opportunity to gain new knowledge about something that's important or exciting to you in the context of the overall subject of the course. Step 2 : If you lack ideas, or wish to gain focus, try any or all of the following strategies: Review your course readings, particularly the suggested readings, for topic ideas. Don't just review what you've already read but jump ahead in the syllabus to readings that have not been covered yet. Search the USC Libraries Catalog for a good, recently published book and, if appropriate, more specialized works related to the discipline area of the course [e.g., for the course SOCI 335: Society and Population, search for books on \"population and society\"]. Browse through some current journals in your subject discipline. Even if most of the articles are not relevant, you can skim through the contents quickly. You only need one to be the spark that begins the process of wanting to learn more about a topic. Consult with a librarian and/or your professor about what constitutes the core journals within your subject discipline. Think about essays you have written for past classes, other courses you have taken, or academic lectures and programs you have attended. Thinking back, what interested you the most? What would you like to know more about? Place this question in the context of the current course assignment. Search online news media sources, such as CNN , the Los Angeles Times , Huffington Post , Fox News , or Newsweek , to see if your idea has been covered by the media. Use this coverage to refine your idea into something that you'd like to investigate further, but in a more deliberate, scholarly way based on a particular problem that needs to be researched. Step 3 : To build upon your initial idea, use the suggestions under this tab to help narrow , broaden , or increase the timeliness of your idea so you can write it out as a research problem. Once you are comfortable with having turned your idea into a research problem, follow Steps 1 - 4 listed in Part I above to further develop it into a research paper.

In thinking about a research topic to study, don't adopt the mindset of pursuing an esoteric or incredibly complicated topic just to impress your professor but that, in reality, does not have any real interest to you. Choose a topic that is challenging but that has at least some interest to you or that you care about. Obviously, this is easier for courses within your major, but even for those nasty prerequisite classes that you must take in order to graduate [and that provide an additional tuition revenue for the university], try to apply issues associated with your major to the general topic given to you. For example, if you are an international relations major taking a philosophy class where the assignment asks you to apply the question of \"what is truth\" to some aspect of life, you could choose to study how government leaders attempt to shape truth through the use of propaganda."

            "box_title": "Proofreading Strategies",
            "box_content": "Proofreading is often the final act before handing in your paper. It is important because most professors grade papers not only on the quality of how you addressed the research problem and the overall organization of the study, but also on the quality of the grammar, punctuation, formatting, and narrative flow of your paper. The assigning of research papers is not just an exercise in developing good research and critical thinking skills, but it is also intended to help you become a better writer. Below are step-by-step strategies you can follow. Before You Proofread Revise the larger aspects of the text . Don't proofread for the purpose of making corrections at the sentence and word level [the act of editing] if you still need to work on the overall focus, development, and organization of the paper or you need to re-arrange or change specific sections [the act of revising]. Set your paper aside between writing and proofreading . Give yourself a day or so between the writing of your paper and proofreading it. This will help you identify mistakes more easily. This is also a reason why you shouldn't wait until the last minute to draft your paper because it won't provide the time needed to step away before proofreading. Eliminate unnecessary words before looking for mistakes . Throughout your paper, you should try to avoid using inflated diction if a more concise phrase works equally well. Simple, precise language is easier to proofread than overly complex sentence constructions and vocabulary. At the same time, also identify and change empty or repetitive phrases. Know what to look for . Make a mental note of the mistakes you need to watch for based on comments from your professor on previous drafts of the paper or that you have received about papers written in other classes. This will help you to identify repeated patterns of mistakes more readily. Review your list of references . Review the sources mentioned in your paper and make sure you have properly cited them in your bibliography. Also make sure that the titles cited in your bibliography are mentioned in the text. Any omissions should be resolved before you begin proofreading your paper. NOTE: Do not confuse the act of revising your paper with the act of editing it. Editing is intended to tighten up language so that your paper is easier to read and understand. This should be the focus when you proofread. If your professor asks you to revise your paper, review the text above concerning ways to improve the overall quality of your paper. The act of revision implies that there is something within the paper that needs to be changed, improved, or re-organized in some significant way. If the reason for a revision is not specified, always ask for clarification. Individualize the Act of Proofreading Individualizing your proofreading process to match weaknesses in your writing will help you correct errors more efficiently and effectively . For example, I still tend to make subject-verb agreement errors. Accept the fact that you likely won't be able to check for everything, so be introspective about what your typical problem areas are and look for each type of error individually. Here's how: Think about what errors you typically make . Review instructors' comments about your writing and/or set up an appointment to review your paper with a staff member in the Writing Center . Learn how to fix those errors . Talk with your professor about helping you understand why you make the errors you do so that you can learn how to avoid them while writing. Use specific strategies . Develop strategies you are most comfortable with to find and correct your particular errors in usage, sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation. Where you proofread is important! Effective and efficient proofreading requires extended focus and concentration. If you are easily distracted by external activity or noise, proofread in a quiet corner of the library rather than at a table in Starbucks. Proofread in several short blocks of time . Avoid trying to proofread your entire paper all at once, otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain your concentration. A good strategy is to start your proofreading each time at the beginning of your paper. It will take longer to make corrections, but you may be surprised how many mistakes you find in text that you have already reviewed. In general, verb tense should be in the following format, although variations can occur within the text of each section depending on the narrative style of your paper. Note that references to prior research mentioned anywhere in your paper should always be stated in the past tense. Abstract--past tense [summary description of what I did] Introduction--present tense [I am describing the study to you now] Literature Review--past tense [the studies I reviewed have already been published] Methodology--past tense [the way I gathered and synthesized data has already happened] Results--past tense [the findings of my study have already been discovered] Discussion--present tense [I am talking to you now about how I interpreted the findings] Conclusion--present tense [I am summarizing the study for you now] General Strategies for Strengthening Your Paper As noted above, proofreading involves a detailed examination of your paper to ensure there are no content errors. However, proofreading is also an opportunity to strengthen the overall quality of your paper beyond correcting specific grammar, diction, or formatting mistakes. Before you begin reviewing your paper line-by-line, step back and reflect on what you have written; consider if there are ways to improve each section of the paper by taking into consideration the following \u201cbig picture\u201d elements of good writing. Introduction . Look for any language that reflects broad generalizations, indeterminate phrasing, or text that does not directly inform the reader about the research and its significance. This can include unnecessary qualifiers or text, such as, \"This study includes a significant review of the literature [what constitutes \"significant\"?], \"There are a number of findings that are important [just state the number of findings; leave it to the discussion to argue the context of their importance], and, for example, \"This research reminds me of....\" [why does the research study relate to remembering something; is this first person perspective essential to introducing the research problem]. Research Topic . Make sure the topic does not come across as ambiguous, simplistic, overly broad, or ill-defined. A strong research problem and the associated research questions establish a set of assumptions that should be nuanced, yet challenges the reader to think. Review the Choosing a Research Problem page in this guide. Place yourself in the position of a reader totally unfamiliar with the topic, then, critically evaluate the research problem, any associated research questions you are trying to address, and the theoretical framework. Ask yourself if there is anything that may not make sense or requires further explanation or refinement. The rest of the paper will build on these elements, but the introduction of these foundational aspects of your paper should be clearly and concisely stated. Paragraph Transitions . Review the overall paper to make sure the narrative flow is coherent throughout and that there are smooth transitions between paragraphs. Ensure that major transitions in text have a heading or sub-heading [if needed] and that the paragraph prior to the transition let's the reader know that you are about to shift to a new idea. Also, look for text that is overly long or that contains too much description and too little analysis and interpretation. Sometimes you need a long paragraph to describe a complex idea, event, or issue, but review them to make sure they can't be broken apart into shorter, more readable paragraphs. Discussion of Results . Read over your discussion of the research findings and make sure you have not treated any of the evidence as unproblematic or uncomplicated. Make sure you have discussed the results through a critical lens of analysis that takes into account alternative interpretations or possible counter-arguments. In most cases, your discussion section should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the study's findings and their implications, both positive, supportive findings and negative, unanticipated findings. Conclusion . Make sure you have done more than simply re-state the research problem and what you did. Provide the reader with a sense of closure by ensuring that the conclusion has highlighted all the main points of the paper and tells the reader why the study was important, what the paper's broader significance and implications might be, and, if applicable, what areas of the study require further research. Also note that the conclusion is usually no more than two or three paragraphs. If your conclusion is longer, look for ways to condense the text and be alert to information that is superfluous or should be integrated into other parts of your paper [e.g., new information]. Specific Strategies to Help Identify Errors Once you have made any necessary revisions to your paper and looked for ways to strengthen its overall quality, focus on identifying and correcting specific errors within the text. Work from a printout, not a computer screen . Besides sparing your eyes from the strain of glaring at a computer screen, proofreading from a printout allows you to easily skip around to where errors might have been repeated throughout the paper [e.g., misspelling the name of a person]. Read out loud . This is especially helpful for spotting run-on sentences and missing words, but you'll also hear other problems that you may not have identified while reading the text out loud. This will also help you adopt the role of the reader, thereby helping you to understand the paper as your audience might. Use a ruler or blank sheet of paper to cover up the lines below the one you're reading . This technique keeps you from skipping over possible mistakes and allows you to deliberately pace yourself as you read through your paper. Circle or highlight every punctuation mark in your paper . This forces you to pay attention to each mark you used and to confirm its purpose in each sentence or paragraph. This is a particularly helpful strategy if you tend to misuse or overuse a punctuation mark, such as a comma or semi-colon. Use the search function of the computer to find mistakes . Using the Ctrl F search [find] feature can help identify repeated errors faster. For example, if you overuse a phrase or repeatedly rely on the same qualifier [e.g., \"important\"], you can do a search for those words or phrases and in each instance make a decision about whether to remove it, rewrite the sentence, or use a synonym. If you tend to make many mistakes, check separately for each kind of error , moving from the most to the least important, and following whatever technique works best for you to identify that kind of mistake. For instance, read through once [backwards, sentence by sentence] to check for fragments; read through again [forward] to be sure subjects and verbs agree, and again [perhaps using a computer search for \"this,\" \"it,\" and \"they\"] to trace pronouns to antecedents. End with using a computer spell checker or reading backwards word by word . Remember that a spell checker won't catch mistakes with homonyms [e.g., \"they're,\" \"their,\" \"there\"] or certain word-to-word typos [like typing \"he\" when you meant to write \"the\"]. The spell-checker function can catch some errors quickly, but it is not a substitute for carefully reviewing the text. This also applies to the grammar check function as well. Leave yourself enough time . Since many errors are made and overlooked by speeding through writing and proofreading, setting aside the time to carefully review your writing will help you identify errors you might otherwise miss. Always read through your writing slowly. If you read through the paper at a normal speed, you won't give your eyes sufficient time to spot errors. Ask a friend to read your paper . Offer to proofread a friend's paper if they will review yours. Having another set of eyes look over your writing will often spot errors that you would have otherwise missed. NOTE: Pay particular attention to the spelling of proper nouns [an individual person, place, or organization]. Make sure the name is carefully capitalized and spelled correctly, and that this spelling has been used consistently throughout the text of your paper. This is especially true for proper nouns transliterated into English or that have been spelled differently over time. In this case, choose the spelling most consistently used by researchers in the literature you have cited so, if asked, you can explain the logic of your choice.

The act of citing sources is also your best defense against allegations of plagiarism. Citing the works of others is important because: Proper citation allows readers to locate the materials you used . Citations to sources helps readers expand their knowledge on a topic. One of the most effective strategies for locating authoritative, relevant sources about a topic is to review footnotes or references from known sources [\"citation tracking\"]. Citing other people's words and ideas demonstrates that you have conducted a thorough review of the literature on your topic and, therefore, you are reporting your research from an informed and critically engaged perspective. The list of sources used increases your credibility as the author of the work. Other researcher's ideas can be used to reinforce your arguments . In many cases, another researcher's arguments can act as the primary context from which you can emphasize the significance of your study and to provide supporting evidence about how you addressed the \"So What?\" question. The ideas of other researchers can be used to explain reasons for alternative approaches . If you disagree with a researcher's ideas or you believe there is a gap in understanding the research problem, your citations can serve as sources from which to argue an alternative viewpoint or the need to pursue a different course of action. Just as the ideas of other researchers can bolster your arguments, they can also detract from your credibility if their research is challenged . Properly citing sources prevents your reputation from being tarnished if the facts or ideas of those cited are proven to be inaccurate or off-base. It prevents readers from concluding that you ignored or dismissed the findings of others, even if they are disputed. Ideas are considered intellectual property and there can be serious repercussions if you fail to cite where you got an idea from . In academe, failure to cite other people's intellectual property could lead to receiving a failing grade for the assignment or the course. In the professional world, failure to cite other people's intellectual property ruins careers and reputations and can result in legal action. Citing sources as a student in college will help you get in the habit of acknowledging and properly citing the work of others. NOTE: In any academic writing, you are required to identify which ideas, facts, thoughts, and concepts are yours and which are derived from the research and work of others. Whether you summarize, paraphrase, or use direct quotes, if it's not your original idea, the source must be acknowledged. The only possible exception to this rule is information that is considered to be a commonly known fact [e.g., George Washington was the first president of the United States]. Appreciate, however, that any \"commonly known fact\" is culturally constructed and shaped by social and aesthetical biases . If you are in doubt about\u00a0whether or not a fact is\u00a0common knowledge, protect yourself from an allegation of plagiarism\u00a0and provide a supporting citation, or, ask your professor for clarification about how a factual statement should be cited.

            "box_content": "Referencing your sources means systematically showing what information or ideas you are quoting or paraphrasing from another author\u2019s work, and identifying where that information come from . You must cite research in order to do research, but at the same time, you must delineate what are your original thoughts and ideas and what are the thoughts and ideas of others. Procedures used to cite sources vary among different fields of study. Always speak with your professor about what writing style for citing sources should be used for the class because it is important to fully understand the citation style to be used in your paper, and to apply it consistently. If your professor defers and tells you to \"choose whatever you want, just be consistent,\" then choose the citation style you are most familiar with or that is appropriate to your major [e.g., use Chicago style if its a history class; use APA if its an education course; use MLA if it is literature or a general writing course]. GENERAL GUIDELINES 1. Should I avoid referencing other people's work? No! If placed in the proper context, r eferencing other people's research is never an indication that your work is substandard or lacks originality. In fact, the opposite is true. If you write your paper without adequate references to previous studies, you are signaling to the reader that you are not familiar with the literature about the topic, thereby, undermining the validity of your study and your credibility as a researcher. Including references in academic writing not only defends you against allegations of plagiarism, but it is one of the most important ways to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of previous investigations about the research problem. It is the intellectual packaging around which you present your study to the reader. 2. What should I do if I find that my idea has already been examined by another researcher? Do not ignore another author's work because doing so will lead your readers to believe that you have either borrowed the idea or information without properly referencing it [this is plagiarism] or that you have failed to conduct a thorough review of the literature. You can acknowledge the other research by writing in the text of your paper something like this: [see also Smith, 2002], then citing the complete source in your list of references. Use the discovery of prior research as an opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the problem being investigated and, if applicable, as a means of delineating your analysis from those of others [e.g., the prior study is ten years old and doesn't take into account new variables]. Reacting to prior research can include: stating how your study updates previous studies on the topic, offering a new or different perspective, using a different method of data gathering, and/or describing a new set of guidelines, recommendations, best practices, or working solutions. 3. What should I do if I want to use an adapted version of someone else's work? You still must cite the original work. For example, maybe you are using a table of statistics from a journal article published in 1996 by author Smith, but you have altered or added new data to it. Reference the revised chart, such as, [adapted from Smith, 1996], then cite the complete source in your list of references. You can also use other terms in order to specify the exact relationship between the original source and the version you have presented, such as, \"based on Smith [1996]...,\" or \"summarized from Smith [1996]....\" Citing the original source helps the reader locate where the information was first presented and under what context it was used as well as to evaluate how effectively you applied it to your own research. 4. What should I do if several authors have published very similar information or ideas? You can indicate that the idea or information can be found in the work of others by stating something similar to the following example: \"Though in fact many scholars have applied this theory to understanding economic relations among nations [for example, see Smith, 1989; Jones, 1991; Johnson, 1994; Anderson, 2003], little attention has been given to applying the theory to examining the actions of non-governmental organizations in a globalized economy.\" If you only reference one author or only the most recent study, then your readers may assume that only one author has published on this topic, or more likely, conclude that you have not conducted a thorough literature review. Referencing all relevant authors of prior studies gives your readers a clear idea of the breadth of analysis you conducted in preparing to study the research problem. If there has been significant number of prior studies on the topic, describe the most comprehensive and recent works because they will presumably discuss and reference the older studies. However, note that there has been significant scholarship devoted to the topic so the reader knows that you are aware of this. 5. What if I find exactly what I want to say in the writing of another researcher? In the social sciences, the rationale in duplicating prior research is generally governed by the passage of time, changing circumstances or conditions, or the introduction of new variables that necessitate a new investigation . If someone else has recently conducted a thorough investigation of precisely the same research problem as you, then you likely will have to revise your topic, or at the very least, review this literature to identify something new to say about the problem. However, if it is someone else's particularly succinct expression, but it fits perfectly with what you are trying to say, then you can quote it directly, referencing the source. Do not see this as a setback or become discouraged if you discover that your brilliant idea or important insight has already been identified by someone else. Identifying an author who has made the same point as you can be an opportunity to add legitimacy to, as well as reinforce the significance of, the research problem you are investigating. The key is to build on that idea in new and innovative ways. If you are not sure how to do this, consult with a librarian! 6. Should I cite a source even if it was published long ago? Any resource used in writing your paper should be cited, regardless of when the study was written. However, in building a case for understanding prior research about your topic, it is generally true that you should focus on citing more recently published studies because they presumably have built upon the research of older publications. This is particularly true of new or revised editions of books, unless an older edition has unique information not\u00a0carried over into newer editions. When referencing prior studies, use the research problem as your guide when considering what to cite. If a study from forty years ago investigated the same research problem, it probably should be examined and considered in your list of references because the research may have been foundational or groundbreaking even if its findings are no longer relevant to current conditions or reflect current thinking [one way to determine if a study is foundational or groundbreaking is to examine how often it has been cited in recent studies using the \"Cited by\" feature of Google Scholar ]. However, if an older study only relates to the research problem tangentially or it has not been cited in recent studies, then it may be more appropriate to list it under further readings .

How do you know when you have enough information in your abstract? A simple rule-of-thumb is to imagine that you are another researcher doing a similar study. Then ask yourself: if your abstract was the only part of the paper you could access, would you be happy with the amount of information presented there? Does it tell the whole story about your study?

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 Types of Abstracts To begin, you need to determine which type of abstract you should include with your paper. There are four general types. Critical Abstract A critical abstract provides, in addition to describing main findings and information, a judgment or comment about the study\u2019s validity, reliability, or completeness. The researcher evaluates the paper and often compares it with other works on the same subject. Critical abstracts are generally 400-500 words in length due to the additional interpretive commentary. These types of abstracts are used infrequently. Descriptive Abstract A descriptive abstract indicates the type of information found in the work. It makes no judgments about the work, nor does it provide results or conclusions of the research. It does incorporate key words found in the text and may include the purpose, methods, and scope of the research. Essentially, the descriptive abstract only describes the work being summarized. Some researchers consider it an outline of the work, rather than a summary. Descriptive abstracts are usually very short, 100 words or less. Informative Abstract The majority of abstracts are informative. While they still do not critique or evaluate a work, they do more than describe it. A good informative abstract acts as a surrogate for the work itself. That is, the researcher presents and explains all the main arguments and the important results and evidence in the paper. An informative abstract includes the information that can be found in a descriptive abstract [purpose, methods, scope] but it also includes the results and conclusions of the research and the recommendations of the author. The length varies according to discipline, but an informative abstract is usually no more than 300 words in length. Highlight Abstract A highlight abstract is specifically written to attract the reader\u2019s attention to the study. No pretense is made of there being either a balanced or complete picture of the paper and, in fact, incomplete and leading remarks may be used to spark the reader\u2019s interest. In that a highlight abstract cannot stand independent of its associated article, it is not a true abstract and, therefore, rarely used in academic writing. II.\u00a0 Writing Style Use the active voice when possible , but note that much of your abstract may require passive sentence constructions. Regardless, write your abstract using concise, but complete, sentences. Get to the point quickly and always use the past tense because you are reporting on a study that has been completed. Formatting Abstracts should be formatted as a single paragraph in a block format and with no paragraph indentations. In most cases, the abstract page immediately follows the title page. Do not number the page. Rules set forth in writing manual vary but, in general, you should center the word \"Abstract\" at the top of the page with double spacing between the heading and the abstract. The final sentences of an abstract concisely summarize your study\u2019s conclusions, implications, or applications to practice and, if appropriate, can be followed by a statement about the need for additional research revealed from the findings. Composing Your Abstract Although it is the first section of your paper, the abstract should be written last since it will summarize the contents of your entire paper. A good strategy to begin composing your abstract is to take whole sentences or key phrases from each section of the paper and put them in a sequence that summarizes the contents. Then revise or add connecting phrases or words to make the narrative flow clearly and smoothly. Note that statistical findings should be reported parenthetically [i.e., written in parentheses]. Before handing in your final paper, check to make sure that the information in the abstract completely agrees with what you have written in the paper. Think of the abstract as a sequential set of complete sentences describing the most crucial information using the fewest necessary words. The abstract SHOULD NOT contain: A catchy introductory phrase, provocative quote, or other device to grab the reader's attention, Lengthy background or contextual information, Redundant phrases, unnecessary adverbs and adjectives, and repetitive information; Acronyms or abbreviations, References to other literature [say something like, \"current research shows that...\" or \"studies have indicated...\"], Using ellipticals [i.e., ending with \"...\"] or incomplete sentences, Jargon or terms that may be confusing to the reader, Citations to other works, and Any sort of image, illustration, figure, or table, or references to them.

A common question asked at the start of any paper is, \"Where should I begin?\" An equally important question to ask yourself is, \"When do I begin?\" Research problems in the social sciences rarely rest in isolation from history. Therefore, it is important to lay a foundation for understanding the historical context underpinning the research problem. However, this information should be brief and succinct and begin at a point in time that illustrates the study's overall importance. For example, a study that investigates coffee cultivation and export in West Africa as a key stimulus for local economic growth needs to describe the beginning of exporting coffee in the region and establishing why economic growth is important. You do not need to give a long historical explanation about coffee exports in Africa. If a research problem requires a substantial exploration of the historical context, do this in the literature review section.

What did we know about this topic before I did this study? How will this study advance new knowledge or new ways of understanding? According to Reyes, there are three overarching goals of a good introduction: 1) ensure that you summarize prior studies about the topic in a manner that lays a foundation for understanding the research problem; 2) explain how your study specifically addresses gaps in the literature, insufficient consideration of the topic, or other deficiency in the literature; and, 3) note the broader theoretical, empirical, and/or policy contributions and implications of your research. A well-written introduction is important because, quite simply, you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. The opening paragraphs of your paper will provide your readers with their initial impressions about the logic of your argument, your writing style, the overall quality of your research, and, ultimately, the validity of your findings and conclusions. A vague, disorganized, or error-filled introduction will create a negative impression, whereas, a concise, engaging, and well-written introduction will lead your readers to think highly of your analytical skills, your writing style, and your research approach. All introductions should conclude with a brief paragraph that describes the organization of the rest of the paper.

            "box_title": "Structure and Writing Style",
            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 Structure and Approach The introduction is the broad beginning of the paper that answers three important questions for the reader: What is this? Why should I read it? What do you want me to think about / consider doing / react to? Think of the structure of the introduction as an inverted triangle of information that lays a foundation for understanding the research problem. Organize the information so as to present the more general aspects of the topic early in the introduction, then narrow your analysis to more specific topical information that provides context, finally arriving at your research problem and the rationale for studying it [often written as a series of key questions to be addressed or framed as a hypothesis or set of assumptions to be tested] and, whenever possible, a description of the potential outcomes your study can reveal. These are general phases associated with writing an introduction: 1.\u00a0 Establish an area to research by: Highlighting the importance of the topic, and/or Making general statements about the topic, and/or Presenting an overview on current research on the subject. 2.\u00a0 Identify a research niche by: Opposing an existing assumption, and/or Revealing a gap in existing research, and/or Formulating a research question or problem, and/or Continuing a disciplinary tradition. 3.\u00a0 Place your research within the research niche by: Stating the intent of your study, Outlining the key characteristics of your study, Describing important results, and Giving a brief overview of the structure of the paper. NOTE: It is often useful to review the introduction late in the writing process. This is appropriate because outcomes are unknown until you've completed the study. After you complete writing the body of the paper, go back and review introductory descriptions of the structure of the paper, the method of data gathering, the reporting and analysis of results, and the conclusion. Reviewing and, if necessary, rewriting the introduction ensures that it correctly matches the overall structure of your final paper. II.\u00a0 Delimitations of the Study Delimitations refer to those characteristics that limit the scope and define the conceptual boundaries of your research . This is determined by the conscious exclusionary and inclusionary decisions you make about how to investigate the research problem. In other words, not only should you tell the reader what it is you are studying and why, but you must also acknowledge why you rejected alternative approaches that could have been used to examine the topic. Obviously, the first limiting step was the choice of research problem itself. However, implicit are other, related problems that could have been chosen but were rejected. These should be noted in the conclusion of your introduction. For example, a delimitating statement could read, \"Although many factors can be understood to impact the likelihood young people will vote, this study will focus on socioeconomic factors related to the need to work full-time while in school.\" The point is not to document every possible delimiting factor, but to highlight why previously researched issues related to the topic were not addressed. Examples of delimitating choices would be: The key aims and objectives of your study, The research questions that you address, The variables of interest [i.e., the various factors and features of the phenomenon being studied], The method(s) of investigation, The time period your study covers, and Any relevant alternative theoretical frameworks that could have been adopted. Review each of these decisions. Not only do you clearly establish what you intend to accomplish in your research, but you should also include a declaration of what the study does not intend to cover. In the latter case, your exclusionary decisions should be based upon criteria understood as, \"not interesting\"; \"not directly relevant\"; \u201ctoo problematic because...\"; \"not feasible,\" and the like. Make this reasoning explicit! NOTE: Delimitations refer to the initial choices made about the broader, overall design of your study and should not be confused with documenting the limitations of your study discovered after the research has been completed. ANOTHER NOTE : Do not view delimitating statements as admitting to an inherent failing or shortcoming in your research. They are an accepted element of academic writing intended to keep the reader focused on the research problem by explicitly defining the conceptual boundaries and scope of your study. It addresses any critical questions in the reader's mind of, \"Why the hell didn't the author examine this?\" III.\u00a0 The Narrative Flow Issues to keep in mind that will help the narrative flow in your introduction : Your introduction should clearly identify the subject area of interest . A simple strategy to follow is to use key words from your title in the first few sentences of the introduction. This will help focus the introduction on the topic at the appropriate level and ensures that you get to the subject matter quickly without losing focus, or discussing information that is too general. Establish context by providing a brief and balanced review of the pertinent published literature that is available on the subject. The key is to summarize for the reader what is known about the specific research problem before you did your analysis. This part of your introduction should not represent a comprehensive literature review--that comes next. It consists of a general review of the important, foundational research literature [with citations] that establishes a foundation for understanding key elements of the research problem. See the drop-down menu under this tab for \" Background Information \" regarding types of contexts. Clearly state the hypothesis that you investigated . When you are first learning to write in this format it is okay, and actually preferable, to use a past statement like, \"The purpose of this study was to....\" or \"We investigated three possible mechanisms to explain the....\" Why did you choose this kind of research study or design? Provide a clear statement of the rationale for your approach to the problem studied. This will usually follow your statement of purpose in the last paragraph of the introduction. IV.\u00a0 Engaging the Reader A research problem in the social sciences can come across as dry and uninteresting to anyone unfamiliar with the topic . Therefore, one of the goals of your introduction is to make readers want to read your paper. Here are several strategies you can use to grab the reader's attention: Open with a compelling story . Almost all research problems in the social sciences, no matter how obscure or esoteric , are really about the lives of people. Telling a story that humanizes an issue can help illuminate the significance of the problem and help the reader empathize with those affected by the condition being studied. Include a strong quotation or a vivid, perhaps unexpected, anecdote . During your review of the literature, make note of any quotes or anecdotes that grab your attention because they can used in your introduction to highlight the research problem in a captivating way. Pose a provocative or thought-provoking question . Your research problem should be framed by a set of questions to be addressed or hypotheses to be tested. However, a provocative question can be presented in the beginning of your introduction that challenges an existing assumption or compels the reader to consider an alternative viewpoint that helps establish the significance of your study. Describe a puzzling scenario or incongruity . This involves highlighting an interesting quandary concerning the research problem or describing contradictory findings from prior studies about a topic. Posing what is essentially an unresolved intellectual riddle about the problem can engage the reader's interest in the study. Cite a stirring example or case study that illustrates why the research problem is important . Draw upon the findings of others to demonstrate the significance of the problem and to describe how your study builds upon or offers alternatives ways of investigating this prior research. NOTE: It is important that you choose only one of the suggested strategies for engaging your readers. This avoids giving an impression that your paper is more flash than substance and does not distract from the substance of your study. Freedman, Leora\u00a0 and Jerry Plotnick.

However, anyone can look a word up in the dictionary and a general dictionary is not a particularly authoritative source because it doesn't take into account the context of your topic and doesn't offer particularly detailed information. Also, placed in the context of a particular discipline, a term or concept may have a different meaning than what is found in a general dictionary. If you feel that you must seek out an authoritative definition, use a subject specific dictionary or encyclopedia [e.g., if you are a sociology student, search for dictionaries of sociology].

A roadmap is important because it helps the reader place the research problem within the context of their own perspectives about the topic. In addition, concluding your introduction with an explicit roadmap tells the reader that you have a clear understanding of the structural purpose of your paper. In this way, the roadmap acts as a type of promise to yourself and to your readers that you will follow a consistent and coherent approach to addressing the topic of inquiry.

            "box_content": "Knowing the Relationship Between Theories and Methods There can be multiple meaning associated with the term \"theories\" and the term \"methods\" in social sciences research. A helpful way to delineate between them is to understand \"theories\" as representing different ways of characterizing the social world when you research it and \"methods\" as representing different ways of generating and analyzing data about that social world. Framed in this way, all empirical social sciences research involves theories and methods, whether they are stated explicitly or not. However, while theories and methods are often related, it is important that, as a researcher, you deliberately separate them in order to avoid your theories playing a disproportionate role in shaping what outcomes your chosen methods produce. Introspectively engage in an ongoing dialectic between the application of theories and methods to help enable you to use the outcomes from your methods to interrogate and develop new theories, or ways of framing conceptually the research problem. This is how scholarship grows and branches out into new intellectual territory. Reynolds, R. Larry. Ways of Knowing. Alternative Microeconomics . Part 1, Chapter 3.

            "box_content": "You must explain how you obtained and analyzed your results for the following reasons: Readers need to know how the data was obtained because the method you chose affects the results and, by extension, how you interpreted their significance in the discussion section of your paper. Methodology is crucial for any branch of scholarship because an unreliable method produces unreliable results and, as a consequence, undermines the value of your analysis of the findings. In most cases, there are a variety of different methods you can choose to investigate a research problem. The methodology section of your paper should clearly articulate the reasons why you have chosen a particular procedure or technique. The reader wants to know that the data was collected or generated in a way that is consistent with accepted practice in the field of study. For example, if you are using a multiple choice questionnaire, readers need to know that it offered your respondents a reasonable range of answers to choose from. The method must be appropriate to fulfilling the overall aims of the study. For example, you need to ensure that you have a large enough sample size to be able to generalize and make recommendations based upon the findings. The methodology should discuss the problems that were anticipated and the steps you took to prevent them from occurring. For any problems that do arise, you must describe the ways in which they were minimized or why these problems do not impact in any meaningful way your interpretation of the findings. In the social and behavioral sciences, it is important to always provide sufficient information to allow other researchers to adopt or replicate your methodology. This information is particularly important when a new method has been developed or an innovative use of an existing method is utilized. Bem, Daryl J. Writing the Empirical Journal Article.

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 Groups of Research Methods There are two main groups of research methods in the social sciences: The e mpirical-analytical group approaches the study of social sciences in a similar manner that researchers study the natural sciences . This type of research focuses on objective knowledge, research questions that can be answered yes or no, and operational definitions of variables to be measured. The empirical-analytical group employs deductive reasoning that uses existing theory as a foundation for formulating hypotheses that need to be tested. This approach is focused on explanation. The i nterpretative group of methods is focused on understanding phenomenon in a comprehensive, holistic way . Interpretive methods focus on analytically disclosing the meaning-making practices of human subjects [the why, how, or by what means people do what they do], while showing how those practices arrange so that it can be used to generate observable outcomes. Interpretive methods allow you to recognize your connection to the phenomena under investigation. However, the interpretative group requires careful examination of variables because it focuses more on subjective knowledge. II.\u00a0 Content The introduction to your methodology section should begin by restating the research problem and underlying assumptions underpinning your study. This is followed by situating the methods you used to gather, analyze, and process information within the overall \u201ctradition\u201d of your field of study and within the particular research design you have chosen to study the problem. If the method you choose lies outside of the tradition of your field [i.e., your review of the literature demonstrates that the method is not commonly used], provide a justification for how your choice of methods specifically addresses the research problem in ways that have not been utilized in prior studies. The remainder of your methodology section should describe the following: Decisions made in selecting the data you have analyzed or, in the case of qualitative research, the subjects and research setting you have examined, Tools and methods used to identify and collect information, and how you identified relevant variables, The ways in which you processed the data and the procedures you used to analyze that data, and The specific research tools or strategies that you utilized to study the underlying hypothesis and research questions. In addition, an effectively written methodology section should: Introduce the overall methodological approach for investigating your research problem . Is your study qualitative or quantitative or a combination of both (mixed method)? Are you going to take a special approach, such as action research, or a more neutral stance? Indicate how the approach fits the overall research design . Your methods for gathering data should have a clear connection to your research problem. In other words, make sure that your methods will actually address the problem. One of the most common deficiencies found in research papers is that the proposed methodology is not suitable to achieving the stated objective of your paper. Describe the specific methods of data collection you are going to use , such as, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, observation, archival research. If you are analyzing existing data, such as a data set or archival documents, describe how it was originally created or gathered and by whom. Also be sure to explain how older data is still relevant to investigating the current research problem. Explain how you intend to analyze your results . Will you use statistical analysis? Will you use specific theoretical perspectives to help you analyze a text or explain observed behaviors? Describe how you plan to obtain an accurate assessment of relationships, patterns, trends, distributions, and possible contradictions found in the data. Provide background and a rationale for methodologies that are unfamiliar for your readers . Very often in the social sciences, research problems and the methods for investigating them require more explanation/rationale than widely accepted rules governing the natural and physical sciences. Be clear and concise in your explanation. Provide a justification for subject selection and sampling procedure . For instance, if you propose to conduct interviews, how do you intend to select the sample population? If you are analyzing texts, which texts have you chosen, and why? If you are using statistics, why is this set of data being used? If other data sources exist, explain why the data you chose is most appropriate to addressing the research problem. Provide a justification for case study selection . A common method of analyzing research problems in the social sciences is to analyze specific cases. These can be a person, place, event, phenomenon, or other type of subject of analysis that are either examined as a singular topic of in-depth investigation or multiple topics of investigation studied for the purpose of comparing or contrasting findings. In either method, you should explain why a case or cases were chosen and how they specifically relate to the research problem. Describe potential limitations . Are there any practical limitations that could affect your data collection? How will you attempt to control for potential confounding variables and errors? If your methodology may lead to problems you can anticipate, state this openly and show why pursuing this methodology outweighs the risk of these problems cropping up. NOTE : Once you have written all of the elements of the methods section, subsequent revisions should focus on how to present those elements as clearly and as logically as possibly. The description of how you prepared to study the research problem, how you gathered the data, and the protocol for analyzing the data should be organized chronologically. For clarity, when a large amount of detail must be presented, information should be presented in sub-sections according to topic. If necessary, consider using appendices for raw data. ANOTHER NOTE : If you are conducting a qualitative analysis of a research problem , the methodology section generally requires a more elaborate description of the methods used as well as an explanation of the processes applied to gathering and analyzing of data than is generally required for studies using quantitative methods. Because you are the primary instrument for generating the data [e.g., through interviews or observations], the process for collecting that data has a significantly greater impact on producing the findings. Therefore, qualitative research requires a more detailed description of the methods used. YET ANOTHER NOTE : If your study involves interviews, observations, or other qualitative techniques involving human subjects , you may be required to obtain approval from the university's Office for the Protection of Research Subjects before beginning your research. This is not a common procedure for most undergraduate level student research assignments. However, i f your professor states you need approval, you must include a statement in your methods section that you received official endorsement and adequate informed consent from the office and that there was a clear assessment and minimization of risks to participants and to the university. This statement informs the reader that your study was conducted in an ethical and responsible manner. In some cases, the approval notice is included as an appendix to your paper. III.\u00a0 Problems to Avoid Irrelevant Detail The methodology section of your paper should be thorough but concise. Do not provide any background information that does not directly help the reader understand why a particular method was chosen, how the data was gathered or obtained, and how the data was analyzed in relation to the research problem [note: analyzed, not interpreted! Save how you interpreted the findings for the discussion section]. With this in mind, the page length of your methods section will generally be less than any other section of your paper except the conclusion. Unnecessary Explanation of Basic Procedures Remember that you are not writing a how-to guide about a particular method. You should make the assumption that readers possess a basic understanding of how to investigate the research problem on their own and, therefore, you do not have to go into great detail about specific methodological procedures. The focus should be on how you applied a method , not on the mechanics of doing a method. An exception to this rule is if you select an unconventional methodological approach; if this is the case, be sure to explain why this approach was chosen and how it enhances the overall process of discovery. Problem Blindness It is almost a given that you will encounter problems when collecting or generating your data, or, gaps will exist in existing data or archival materials. Do not ignore these problems or pretend they did not occur. Often, documenting how you overcame obstacles can form an interesting part of the methodology. It demonstrates to the reader that you can provide a cogent rationale for the decisions you made to minimize the impact of any problems that arose. Literature Review Just as the literature review section of your paper provides an overview of sources you have examined while researching a particular topic, the methodology section should cite any sources that informed your choice and application of a particular method [i.e., the choice of a survey should include any citations to the works you used to help construct the survey]. It\u2019s More than Sources of Information! A description of a research study's method should not be confused with a description of the sources of information. Such a list of sources is useful in and of itself, especially if it is accompanied by an explanation about the selection and use of the sources. The description of the project's methodology complements a list of sources in that it sets forth the organization and interpretation of information emanating from those sources.

In general, raw data that has not been summarized should not be included in the main text of your paper unless requested to do so by your professor. Avoid providing data that is not critical to answering the research question . The background information you described in the introduction section should provide the reader with any additional context or explanation needed to understand the results. A good strategy is to always re-read the background section of your paper after you have written up your results to ensure that the reader has enough context to understand the results [and, later, how you interpreted the results in the discussion section of your paper that follows].

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 Organization and Approach For most research papers in the social and behavioral sciences, there are two possible ways of organizing the results . Both approaches are appropriate in how you report your findings, but use only one approach. Present a synopsis of the results followed by an explanation of key findings . This approach can be used to highlight important findings. For example, you may have noticed an unusual correlation between two variables during the analysis of your findings. It is appropriate to highlight this finding in the results section. However, speculating as to why this correlation exists and offering a hypothesis about what may be happening belongs in the discussion section of your paper. Present a result and then explain it, before presenting the next result then explaining it, and so on, then end with an overall synopsis . This is the preferred approach if you have multiple results of equal significance. It is more common in longer papers because it helps the reader to better understand each finding. In this model, it is helpful to provide a brief conclusion that ties each of the findings together and provides a narrative bridge to the discussion section of the your paper. NOTE : Just as the literature review should be arranged under conceptual categories rather than systematically describing each source, you should also organize your findings under key themes related to addressing the research problem. This can be done under either format noted above [i.e., a thorough explanation of the key results or a sequential, thematic description and explanation of each finding]. II.\u00a0 Content In general, the content of your results section should include the following: Introductory context for understanding the results by restating the research problem underpinning your study . This is useful in re-orientating the reader's focus back to the research problem after having read a review of the literature and your explanation of the methods used for gathering and analyzing information. Inclusion of non-textual elements, such as, figures, charts, photos, maps, tables, etc. to further illustrate key findings, if appropriate . Rather than relying entirely on descriptive text, consider how your findings can be presented visually. This is a helpful way of condensing a lot of data into one place that can then be referred to in the text. Consider referring to appendices if there is a lot of non-textual elements. A systematic description of your results, highlighting for the reader observations that are most relevant to the topic under investigation . Not all results that emerge from the methodology used to gather information may be related to answering the \" So What? \" question. Do not confuse observations with interpretations; observations in this context refers to highlighting important findings you discovered through a process of reviewing prior literature and gathering data. The page length of your results section is guided by the amount and types of data to be reported . However, focus on findings that are important and related to addressing the research problem. It is not uncommon to have unanticipated results that are not relevant to answering the research question. This is not to say that you don't acknowledge tangential findings and, in fact, can be referred to as areas for further research in the conclusion of your paper. However, spending time in the results section describing tangential findings clutters your overall results section and distracts the reader. A short paragraph that concludes the results section by synthesizing the key findings of the study . Highlight the most important findings you want readers to remember as they transition into the discussion section. This is particularly important if, for example, there are many results to report, the findings are complicated or unanticipated, or they are impactful or actionable in some way [i.e., able to be pursued in a feasible way applied to practice]. NOTE: Always use the past tense when referring to your study's findings. Reference to findings should always be described as having already happened because the method used to gather the information has been completed. III.\u00a0 Problems to Avoid When writing the results section, avoid doing the following : Discussing or interpreting your results . Save this for the discussion section of your paper, although where appropriate, you should compare or contrast specific results to those found in other studies [e.g., \"Similar to the work of Smith [1990], one of the findings of this study is the strong correlation between motivation and academic achievement....\"]. Reporting background information or attempting to explain your findings. This should have been done in your introduction section, but don't panic! Often the results of a study point to the need for additional background information or to explain the topic further, so don't think you did something wrong. Writing up research is rarely a linear process. Always revise your introduction as needed. Ignoring negative results . A negative result generally refers to a finding that does not support the underlying assumptions of your study. Do not ignore them. Document these findings and then state in your discussion section why you believe a negative result emerged from your study. Note that negative results, and how you handle them, can give you an opportunity to write a more engaging discussion section, therefore, don't be hesitant to highlight them. Including raw data or intermediate calculations . Ask your professor if you need to include any raw data generated by your study, such as transcripts from interviews or data files. If raw data is to be included, place it in an appendix or set of appendices that are referred to in the text. Be as factual and concise as possible in reporting your findings . Do not use phrases that are vague or non-specific, such as, \"appeared to be greater than other variables...\" or \"demonstrates promising trends that....\" Subjective modifiers should be explained in the discussion section of the paper [i.e., why did one variable appear greater? Or, how does the finding demonstrate a promising trend?]. Presenting the same data or repeating the same information more than once . If you want to highlight a particular finding, it is appropriate to do so in the results section. However, you should emphasize its significance in relation to addressing the research problem in the discussion section. Do not repeat it in your results section because you can do that in the conclusion of your paper. Confusing figures with tables . Be sure to properly label any non-textual elements in your paper. Don't call a chart an illustration or a figure a table. If you are not sure, go here .

It's not unusual to find articles in scholarly social science journals where the author(s) have combined a description of the findings with a discussion about their significance and implications. You could do this. However, if you are inexperienced writing research papers, consider creating two distinct sections for each section in your paper as a way to better organize your thoughts and, by extension, your paper. Think of the results section as the place where you report what your study found; think of the discussion section as the place where you interpret the information and answer the \"So What?\" question.

            "box_title": "Structure and Writing Style",
            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 General Rules These are the general rules you should adopt when composing your discussion of the results : Do not be verbose or repetitive; be concise and make your points clearly Avoid the use of jargon or undefined technical language Follow a logical stream of thought; in general, interpret and discuss the significance of your findings in the same sequence you described them in your results section [a notable exception is to begin by highlighting an unexpected result or a finding that can grab the reader's attention] Use the present verb tense, especially for established facts; however, refer to specific works or prior studies in the past tense If needed, use subheadings to help organize your discussion or to categorize your interpretations into themes II.\u00a0 The Content The content of the discussion section of your paper most often includes : Explanation of results : Comment on whether or not the results were expected for each set of findings; go into greater depth to explain findings that were unexpected or especially profound. If appropriate, note any unusual or unanticipated patterns or trends that emerged from your results and explain their meaning in relation to the research problem. References to previous research : Either compare your results with the findings from other studies or use the studies to support a claim. This can include re-visiting key sources already cited in your literature review section, or, save them to cite later in the discussion section if they are more important to compare with your results instead of being a part of the general literature review of prior research used to provide context and background information. Note that you can make this decision to highlight specific studies after you have begun writing the discussion section. Deduction : A claim for how the results can be applied more generally. For example, describing lessons learned, proposing recommendations that can help improve a situation, or highlighting best practices. Hypothesis : A more general claim or possible conclusion arising from the results [which may be proved or disproved in subsequent research]. This can be framed as new research questions that emerged as a consequence of your analysis. III.\u00a0 Organization and Structure Keep the following sequential points in mind as you organize and write the discussion section of your paper: Think of your discussion as an inverted pyramid. Organize the discussion from the general to the specific, linking your findings to the literature, then to theory, then to practice [if appropriate]. Use the same key terms, narrative style, and verb tense [present] that you used when describing the research problem in your introduction. Begin by briefly re-stating the research problem you were investigating and answer all of the research questions underpinning the problem that you posed in the introduction. Describe the patterns, principles, and relationships shown by each major findings and place them in proper perspective. The sequence of this information is important; first state the answer, then the relevant results, then cite the work of others. If appropriate, refer the reader to a figure or table to help enhance the interpretation of the data [either within the text or as an appendix]. Regardless of where it's mentioned, a good discussion section includes analysis of any unexpected findings. This part of the discussion should begin with a description of the unanticipated finding, followed by a brief interpretation as to why you believe it appeared and, if necessary, its possible significance in relation to the overall study. If more than one unexpected finding emerged during the study, describe each of them in the order they appeared as you gathered or analyzed the data. As noted, the exception to discussing findings in the same order you described them in the results section would be to begin by highlighting the implications of a particularly unexpected or significant finding that emerged from the study, followed by a discussion of the remaining findings. Before concluding the discussion, identify potential limitations and weaknesses if you do not plan to do so in the conclusion of the paper. Comment on their relative importance in relation to your overall interpretation of the results and, if necessary, note how they may affect the validity of your findings. Avoid using an apologetic tone; however, be honest and self-critical [e.g., in retrospect, had you included a particular question in a survey instrument, additional data could have been revealed]. The discussion section should end with a concise summary of the principal implications of the findings regardless of their significance. Give a brief explanation about why you believe the findings and conclusions of your study are important and how they support broader knowledge or understanding of the research problem. This can be followed by any recommendations for further research. However, do not offer recommendations which could have been easily addressed within the study. This would demonstrate to the reader that you have inadequately examined and interpreted the data. IV.\u00a0 Overall Objectives The objectives of your discussion section should include the following: I. Reiterate the Research Problem/State the Major Findings Briefly reiterate the research problem or problems you are investigating and the methods you used to investigate them, then move quickly to describe the major findings of the study. You should write a direct, declarative, and succinct proclamation of the study results, usually in one paragraph. II. Explain the Meaning of the Findings and Why They are Important No one has thought as long and hard about your study as you have. Systematically explain the underlying meaning of your findings and state why you believe they are significant. After reading the discussion section, you want the reader to think critically about the results and why they are important. You don\u2019t want to force the reader to go through the paper multiple times to figure out what it all means. If applicable, begin this part of the section by repeating what you consider to be your most significant or unanticipated finding first, then systematically review each finding. Otherwise, follow the general order you reported the findings presented in the results section. III. Relate the Findings to Similar Studies No study in the social sciences is so novel or possesses such a restricted focus that it has absolutely no relation to previously published research. The discussion section should relate your results to those found in other studies, particularly if questions raised from prior studies served as the motivation for your research. This is important because comparing and contrasting the findings of other studies helps to support the overall importance of your results and it highlights how and in what ways your study differs from other research about the topic. Note that any significant or unanticipated finding is often because there was no prior research to indicate the finding could occur. If there is prior research to indicate this, you need to explain why it was significant or unanticipated. IV. Consider Alternative Explanations of the Findings It is important to remember that the purpose of research in the social sciences is to discover and not to prove . When writing the discussion section, you should carefully consider all possible explanations for the study results, rather than just those that fit your hypothesis or prior assumptions and biases. This is especially important when describing the discovery of significant or unanticipated findings. V. Acknowledge the Study\u2019s Limitations It is far better for you to identify and acknowledge your study\u2019s limitations than to have them pointed out by your professor! Note any unanswered questions or issues your study could not address and describe the generalizability of your results to other situations. If a limitation is applicable to the method chosen to gather information, then describe in detail the problems you encountered and why. VI. Make Suggestions for Further Research You may choose to conclude the discussion section by making suggestions for further research [as opposed to offering suggestions in the conclusion of your paper]. Although your study can offer important insights about the research problem, this is where you can address other questions related to the problem that remain unanswered or highlight hidden issues that were revealed as a result of conducting your research. You should frame your suggestions by linking the need for further research to the limitations of your study [e.g., in future studies, the survey instrument should include more questions that ask...\"] or linking to critical issues revealed from the data that were not considered initially in your research. NOTE: Besides the literature review section, the preponderance of references to sources is usually found in the discussion section . A few historical references may be helpful for perspective, but most of the references should be relatively recent and included to aid in the interpretation of your results, to support the significance of a finding, and/or to place a finding within a particular context. If a study that you cited does not support your findings, don't ignore it--clearly explain why your research findings differ from theirs. V.\u00a0 Problems to Avoid Do not waste time restating your results . Should you need to remind the reader of a finding to be discussed, use \"bridge sentences\" that relate the result to the interpretation. An example would be: \u201cIn the case of determining available housing to single women with children in rural areas of Texas, the findings suggest that access to good schools is important...,\" then move on to further explaining this finding and its implications. As noted, recommendations for further research can be included in either the discussion or conclusion of your paper, but do not repeat your recommendations in the both sections. Think about the overall narrative flow of your paper to determine where best to locate this information. However, if your findings raise a lot of new questions or issues, consider including suggestions for further research in the discussion section. Do not introduce new results in the discussion section. Be wary of mistaking the reiteration of a specific finding for an interpretation because it may confuse the reader. The description of findings [results section] and the interpretation of their significance [discussion section] should be distinct parts of your paper. If you choose to combine the results section and the discussion section into a single narrative, you must be clear in how you report the information discovered and your own interpretation of each finding. This approach is not recommended if you lack experience writing college-level research papers. Use of the first person pronoun is generally acceptable. Using first person singular pronouns can help emphasize a point or illustrate a contrasting finding. However, keep in mind that too much use of the first person can actually distract the reader from the main points [i.e., I know you're telling me this--just tell me!]. Analyzing vs. Summarizing.

If you feel compelled to speculate, do so in the form of describing possible implications or explaining possible impacts. Be certain that you clearly identify your comments as speculation or as a suggestion for where further research is needed.

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 General Rules The function of your paper's conclusion is to restate the main argument . It reminds the reader of the strengths of your main argument(s) and reiterates the most important evidence supporting those argument(s). Do this by stating clearly the context, background, and necessity of pursuing the research problem you investigated in relation to an issue, controversy, or a gap found in the literature. Make sure, however, that your conclusion is not simply a repetitive summary of the findings. This reduces the impact of the argument(s) you have developed in your essay. When writing the conclusion to your paper, follow these general rules: Present your conclusions in clear, simple language. Re-state the purpose of your study, then describe how your findings differ or support those of other studies and why [i.e., what were the unique or new contributions your study made to the overall research about your topic?]. Do not simply reiterate your findings or the discussion of your results. Provide a synthesis of arguments presented in the paper to show how these converge to address the research problem and the overall objectives of your study. Indicate opportunities for future research if you haven't already done so in the discussion section of your paper. Highlighting the need for further research provides the reader with evidence that you have an in-depth awareness of the research problem and that further investigations should take place. Consider the following points to help ensure your conclusion is presented well: If the argument or purpose of your paper is complex, you may need to summarize the argument for your reader. If, prior to your conclusion, you have not yet explained the significance of your findings or if you are proceeding inductively, use the end of your paper to describe your main points and explain their significance. Move from a detailed to a general level of consideration that returns the topic to the context provided by the introduction or within a new context that emerges from the data. The conclusion also provides a place for you to persuasively and succinctly restate the research problem, given that the reader has now been presented with all the information about the topic . Depending on the discipline you are writing in, the concluding paragraph may contain your reflections on the evidence presented. However, the nature of being introspective about the research you have conducted will depend on the topic and whether your professor wants you to express your observations in this way. NOTE : If asked to think introspectively about the topics, do not delve into idle speculation. Being introspective means looking within yourself as an author to try and understand an issue more deeply, not to guess at possible outcomes or make up scenarios not supported by the evidence. II.\u00a0 Developing a Compelling Conclusion Although an effective conclusion needs to be clear and succinct, it does not need to be written passively or lack a compelling narrative. Strategies to help you move beyond merely summarizing the key points of your research paper may include any of the following strategies: If your essay deals with a critical, contemporary problem, warn readers of the possible consequences of not attending to the problem proactively. Recommend a specific course or courses of action that, if adopted, could address a specific problem in practice or in the development of new knowledge. Cite a relevant quotation or expert opinion already noted in your paper in order to lend authority and support to the conclusion(s) you have reached [a good place to look is research from your literature review]. Explain the consequences of your research in a way that elicits action or demonstrates urgency in seeking change. Restate a key statistic, fact, or visual image to emphasize the most important finding of your paper. If your discipline encourages personal reflection, illustrate your concluding point by drawing from your own life experiences. Return to an anecdote, an example, or a quotation that you presented in your introduction, but add further insight derived from the findings of your study; use your interpretation of results to recast it in new or important ways. Provide a \"take-home\" message in the form of a succinct, declarative statement that you want the reader to remember about your study. III. Problems to Avoid Failure to be concise Your conclusion section should be concise and to the point. Conclusions that are too lengthy often have unnecessary information in them. The conclusion is not the place for details about your methodology or results. Although you should give a summary of what was learned from your research, this summary should be relatively brief, since the emphasis in the conclusion is on the implications, evaluations, insights, and other forms of analysis that you make. Strategies for writing concisely can be found here . Failure to comment on larger, more significant issues In the introduction, your task was to move from the general [the field of study] to the specific [the research problem]. However, in the conclusion, your task is to move from a specific discussion [your research problem] back to a general discussion [i.e., how your research contributes new understanding or fills an important gap in the literature]. In short, the conclusion is where you should place your research within a larger context [visualize your paper as an hourglass--start with a broad introduction and review of the literature, move to the specific analysis and discussion, conclude with a broad summary of the study's implications and significance]. Failure to reveal problems and negative results Negative aspects of the research process should never be ignored. These are problems, deficiencies, or challenges encountered during your study should be summarized as a way of qualifying your overall conclusions. If you encountered negative or unintended results [i.e., findings that are validated outside the research context in which they were generated], you must report them in the results section and discuss their implications in the discussion section of your paper. In the conclusion, use your summary of the negative results as an opportunity to explain their possible significance and/or how they may form the basis for future research. Failure to provide a clear summary of what was learned In order to be able to discuss how your research fits within your field of study [and possibly the world at large], you need to summarize briefly and succinctly how it contributes to new knowledge or a new understanding about the research problem. This element of your conclusion may be only a few sentences long. Failure to match the objectives of your research Often research objectives in the social sciences change while the research is being carried out. This is not a problem unless you forget to go back and refine the original objectives in your introduction. As these changes emerge they must be documented so that they accurately reflect what you were trying to accomplish in your research [not what you thought you might accomplish when you began]. Resist the urge to apologize If you've immersed yourself in studying the research problem, you presumably should know a good deal about it [perhaps even more than your professor!]. Nevertheless, by the time you have finished writing, you may be having some doubts about what you have produced. Repress those doubts! Don't undermine your authority by saying something like, \"This is just one approach to examining this problem; there may be other, much better approaches that....\" The overall tone of your conclusion should convey confidence to the reader.

            "box_content": "The accepted form of academic writing in the social sciences can vary considerable depending on the methodological framework and the intended audience. However, most college-level research papers require careful attention to the following stylistic elements: I.\u00a0 The Big Picture Unlike creative or journalistic writing, the overall structure of academic writing is formal and logical. It must be cohesive and possess a logically organized flow of ideas; this means that the various parts are connected to form a unified whole. There should be narrative links between sentences and paragraphs so that the reader is able to follow your argument. The introduction should include a description of how the rest of the paper is organized and all sources are properly cited throughout the paper. II.\u00a0 Tone The overall tone refers to the attitude conveyed in a piece of writing. Throughout your paper, it is important that you present the arguments of others fairly and with an appropriate narrative tone. When presenting a position or argument that you disagree with, describe this argument accurately and without loaded or biased language. In academic writing, the author is expected to investigate the research problem from an authoritative point of view. You should, therefore, state the strengths of your arguments confidently, using language that is neutral, not confrontational or dismissive. III.\u00a0 Diction Diction refers to the choice of words you use. Awareness of the words you use is important because words that have almost the same denotation [dictionary definition] can have very different connotations [implied meanings]. This is particularly true in academic writing because words and terminology can evolve a nuanced meaning that describes a particular idea, concept, or phenomenon derived from the epistemological culture of that discipline [e.g., the concept of rational choice in political science]. Therefore, use concrete words [not general] that convey a specific meaning. If this cannot be done without confusing the reader, then you need to explain what you mean within the context of how that word or phrase is used within a discipline. IV.\u00a0 Language The investigation of research problems in the social sciences is often complex and multi- dimensional . Therefore, it is important that you use unambiguous language. Well-structured paragraphs and clear topic sentences enable a reader to follow your line of thinking without difficulty. Your language should be concise, formal, and express precisely what you want it to mean. Do not use vague expressions that are not specific or precise enough for the reader to derive exact meaning [\"they,\" \"we,\" \"people,\" \"the organization,\" etc.], abbreviations like 'i.e.'\u00a0 [\"in other words\"], 'e.g.' [\"for example\"], or 'a.k.a.' [\"also known as\"], and the use of unspecific determinate words [\"super,\" \"very,\" \"incredible,\" \"huge,\" etc.]. V.\u00a0 Punctuation Scholars rely on precise words and language to establish the narrative tone of their work and, therefore, punctuation marks are used very deliberately. For example, exclamation points are rarely used to express a heightened tone because it can come across as unsophisticated or over-excited. Dashes should be limited to the insertion of an explanatory comment in a sentence, while hyphens should be limited to connecting prefixes to words [e.g., multi-disciplinary] or when forming compound phrases [e.g., commander-in-chief]. Finally, understand that semi-colons represent a pause that is longer than a comma, but shorter than a period in a sentence. In general, there are four grammatical uses of semi-colons: when a second clause expands or explains the first clause; to describe a sequence of actions or different aspects of the same topic; placed before clauses which begin with \"nevertheless\", \"therefore\", \"even so,\" and \"for instance\u201d; and, to mark off a series of phrases or clauses which contain commas. If you are not confident about when to use semi-colons [and most of the time, they are not required for proper punctuation], rewrite using shorter sentences or revise the paragraph. VI.\u00a0 Academic Conventions Citing sources in the body of your paper and providing a list of references as either footnotes or endnotes is a key feature of academic writing. It is essential to always acknowledge the source of any ideas, research findings, data, paraphrased, or quoted text that you have used in your paper as a defense against allegations of plagiarism. Even more important, the scholarly convention of citing sources allow readers to identify the resources you used in writing your paper so they can independently verify and assess the quality of findings and conclusions based on your review of the literature. Examples of other academic conventions to follow include the appropriate use of headings and subheadings, properly spelling out acronyms when first used in the text, avoiding slang or colloquial language, avoiding emotive language or unsupported declarative statements, avoiding contractions [e.g., isn't], and using first person and second person pronouns only when necessary. VII.\u00a0 Evidence-Based Reasoning Assignments often ask you to express your own point of view about the research problem. However, what is valued in academic writing is that statements are based on evidence-based reasoning. This refers to possessing a clear understanding of the pertinent body of knowledge and academic debates that exist within, and often external to, your discipline concerning the topic. You need to support your arguments with evidence from scholarly [i.e., academic or peer-reviewed] sources. It should be an objective stance presented as a logical argument; the quality of the evidence you cite will determine the strength of your argument. The objective is to convince the reader of the validity of your thoughts through a well-documented, coherent, and logically structured piece of writing. This is particularly important when proposing solutions to problems or delineating recommended courses of action. VIII.\u00a0 Thesis-Driven Academic writing is \u201cthesis-driven,\u201d meaning that the starting point is a particular perspective, idea, or position applied to the chosen topic of investigation, such as, establishing, proving, or disproving solutions to the questions applied to investigating the research problem. Note that a problem statement without the research questions does not qualify as academic writing because simply identifying the research problem does not establish for the reader how you will contribute to solving the problem, what aspects you believe are most critical, or suggest a method for gathering information or data to better understand the problem. IX.\u00a0 Complexity and Higher-Order Thinking Academic writing addresses complex issues that require higher-order thinking skills applied to understanding the research problem [e.g., critical, reflective, logical, and creative thinking as opposed to, for example, descriptive or prescriptive thinking]. Higher-order thinking skills include cognitive processes that are used to comprehend, solve problems, and express concepts or that describe abstract ideas that cannot be easily acted out, pointed to, or shown with images. Think of your writing this way: One of the most important attributes of a good teacher is the ability to explain complexity in a way that is understandable and relatable to the topic being presented during class. This is also one of the main functions of academic writing--examining and explaining the significance of complex ideas as clearly as possible.\u00a0 As a writer, you must adopt the role of a good teacher by summarizing complex information into a well-organized synthesis of ideas, concepts, and recommendations that contribute to a better understanding of the research problem.

            "box_content": "Understanding Academic Writing and Its Jargon The very definition of research jargon is language specific to a particular community of practitioner-researchers . Therefore, in modern university life, jargon represents the specific language and meaning assigned to words and phrases specific to a discipline or area of study. For example, the idea of being rational may hold the same general meaning in both political science and psychology, but its application to understanding and explaining phenomena within the research domain of a each discipline may have subtle differences based upon how scholars in that discipline apply the concept to the theories and practice of their work. Given this, it is important that specialist terminology [i.e., jargon] must be used accurately and applied under the appropriate conditions . Subject-specific dictionaries are the best places to confirm the meaning of terms within the context of a specific discipline. These can be found by either searching in the USC Libraries catalog by entering the disciplinary and the word dictionary [e.g., sociology and dictionary] or using a database such as Credo Reference [a curated collection of subject encyclopedias, dictionaries, handbooks, guides from highly regarded publishers] . It is appropriate for you to use specialist language within your field of study, but you should avoid using such language when writing for non-academic or general audiences. Problems with Opaque Writing A common criticism of scholars is that they can utilize needlessly complex syntax or overly expansive vocabulary that is impenetrable or not well-defined. When writing, avoid problems associated with opaque writing by keeping in mind the following: 1. Excessive use of specialized terminology . Yes, it is appropriate for you to use specialist language and a formal style of expression in academic writing, but it does not mean using \"big words\" just for the sake of doing so. Overuse of complex or obscure words or writing complicated sentence constructions gives readers the impression that your paper is more about style than substance; it leads the reader to question if you really know what you are talking about. Focus on creating clear, concise, and elegant prose that minimizes reliance on specialized terminology. 2. Inappropriate use of specialized terminology . Because you are dealing with concepts, research, and data within your discipline, you need to use the technical language appropriate to that area of study. However, nothing will undermine the validity of your study quicker than the inappropriate application of a term or concept. Avoid using terms whose meaning you are unsure of--do not just guess or assume! Consult the meaning of terms in specialized, discipline-specific dictionaries by searching the USC Libraries catalog or the Credo Reference database [see above]. Additional Problems to Avoid In addition to understanding the use of specialized language, there are other aspects of academic writing in the social sciences that you should be aware of. These problems include: Personal nouns . Excessive use of personal nouns [e.g., I, me, you, us] may lead the reader to believe the study was overly subjective. These words can be interpreted as being used only to avoid presenting empirical evidence about the research problem. Limit the use of personal nouns to descriptions of things you actually did [e.g., \"I interviewed ten teachers about classroom management techniques...\"]. Note that personal nouns are generally found in the discussion section of a paper because this is where you as the author/researcher interpret and describe your work. Directives . Avoid directives that demand the reader to \"do this\" or \"do that.\" Directives should be framed as evidence-based recommendations or goals leading to specific outcomes. Note that an exception to this can be found in various forms of action research that involve evidence-based advocacy for social justice or transformative change. Within this area of the social sciences, authors may offer directives for action in a declarative tone of urgency. Informal, conversational tone using slang and idioms . Academic writing relies on excellent grammar and precise word structure. Your narrative should not include regional dialects or slang terms because they can be open to interpretation. Your writing should be direct and concise using standard English. Wordiness. Focus on being concise, straightforward, and developing a narrative that does not have confusing language . By doing so, you\u00a0 help eliminate the possibility of the reader misinterpreting the design and purpose of your study. Vague expressions (e.g., \"they,\" \"we,\" \"people,\" \"the company,\" \"that area,\" etc.). Being concise in your writing also includes avoiding vague references to persons, places, or things. While proofreading your paper, be sure to look for and edit any vague or imprecise statements that lack context or specificity. Numbered lists and bulleted items . The use of bulleted items or lists should be used only if the narrative dictates a need for clarity. For example, it is fine to state, \"The four main problems with hedge funds are:\" and then list them as 1, 2, 3, 4. However, in academic writing, this must then be followed by detailed explanation and analysis of each item. Given this, the question you should ask yourself while proofreading is: why begin with a list in the first place rather than just starting with systematic analysis of each item arranged in separate paragraphs? Also, be careful using numbers because they can imply a ranked order of priority or importance. If none exists, use bullets and avoid checkmarks or other symbols. Descriptive writing . Describing a research problem is an important means of contextualizing a study. In fact, some description or background information may be needed because you can not assume the reader knows the key aspects of the topic. However, the content of your paper should focus on methodology, the analysis and interpretation of findings, and their implications as they apply to the research problem rather than background information and descriptions of tangential issues. Personal experience. Drawing upon personal experience [e.g., traveling abroad; caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease] can be an effective way of introducing the research problem or engaging your readers in understanding its significance. Use personal experience only as an example, though, because academic writing relies on evidence-based research. To do otherwise is simply story-telling. NOTE: Rules concerning excellent grammar and precise word structure do not apply when quoting someone. A quote should be inserted in the text of your paper exactly as it was stated. If the quote is especially vague or hard to understand, consider paraphrasing it or using a different quote to convey the same meaning. Consider inserting the term \"sic\" in brackets after the quoted text to indicate that the quotation has been transcribed exactly as found in the original source, but the source had grammar, spelling, or other errors. The adverb sic informs the reader that the errors are not yours. Academic Writing. The Writing Lab and The OWL. Purdue University; Academic Writing Style. First-Year Seminar Handbook.

            "box_content": "Understanding Academic Writing and Its Jargon The very definition of research jargon is language specific to a particular community of practitioner-researchers . Therefore, in modern university life, jargon represents the specific language and meaning assigned to words and phrases specific to a discipline or area of study. For example, the idea of being rational may hold the same general meaning in both political science and psychology, but its application to understanding and explaining phenomena within the research domain of a each discipline may have subtle differences based upon how scholars in that discipline apply the concept to the theories and practice of their work. Given this, it is important that specialist terminology [i.e., jargon] must be used accurately and applied under the appropriate conditions . Subject-specific dictionaries are the best places to confirm the meaning of terms within the context of a specific discipline. These can be found by either searching in the USC Libraries catalog by entering the disciplinary and the word dictionary [e.g., sociology and dictionary] or using a database such as Credo Reference [a curated collection of subject encyclopedias, dictionaries, handbooks, guides from highly regarded publishers] . It is appropriate for you to use specialist language within your field of study, but you should avoid using such language when writing for non-academic or general audiences. Problems with Opaque Writing A common criticism of scholars is that they can utilize needlessly complex syntax or overly expansive vocabulary that is impenetrable or not well-defined. When writing, avoid problems associated with opaque writing by keeping in mind the following: 1. Excessive use of specialized terminology . Yes, it is appropriate for you to use specialist language and a formal style of expression in academic writing, but it does not mean using \"big words\" just for the sake of doing so. Overuse of complex or obscure words or writing complicated sentence constructions gives readers the impression that your paper is more about style than substance; it leads the reader to question if you really know what you are talking about. Focus on creating clear, concise, and elegant prose that minimizes reliance on specialized terminology. 2. Inappropriate use of specialized terminology . Because you are dealing with concepts, research, and data within your discipline, you need to use the technical language appropriate to that area of study. However, nothing will undermine the validity of your study quicker than the inappropriate application of a term or concept. Avoid using terms whose meaning you are unsure of--do not just guess or assume! Consult the meaning of terms in specialized, discipline-specific dictionaries by searching the USC Libraries catalog or the Credo Reference database [see above]. Additional Problems to Avoid In addition to understanding the use of specialized language, there are other aspects of academic writing in the social sciences that you should be aware of. These problems include: Personal nouns . Excessive use of personal nouns [e.g., I, me, you, us] may lead the reader to believe the study was overly subjective. These words can be interpreted as being used only to avoid presenting empirical evidence about the research problem. Limit the use of personal nouns to descriptions of things you actually did [e.g., \"I interviewed ten teachers about classroom management techniques...\"]. Note that personal nouns are generally found in the discussion section of a paper because this is where you as the author/researcher interpret and describe your work. Directives . Avoid directives that demand the reader to \"do this\" or \"do that.\" Directives should be framed as evidence-based recommendations or goals leading to specific outcomes. Note that an exception to this can be found in various forms of action research that involve evidence-based advocacy for social justice or transformative change. Within this area of the social sciences, authors may offer directives for action in a declarative tone of urgency. Informal, conversational tone using slang and idioms . Academic writing relies on excellent grammar and precise word structure. Your narrative should not include regional dialects or slang terms because they can be open to interpretation. Your writing should be direct and concise using standard English. Wordiness. Focus on being concise, straightforward, and developing a narrative that does not have confusing language . By doing so, you\u00a0 help eliminate the possibility of the reader misinterpreting the design and purpose of your study. Vague expressions (e.g., \"they,\" \"we,\" \"people,\" \"the company,\" \"that area,\" etc.). Being concise in your writing also includes avoiding vague references to persons, places, or things. While proofreading your paper, be sure to look for and edit any vague or imprecise statements that lack context or specificity. Numbered lists and bulleted items .

The act of thinking about precedes the process of writing about. Good writers spend sufficient time distilling information and reviewing major points from the literature they have reviewed before creating their work. Writing detailed outlines can help you clearly organize your thoughts. Effective academic writing begins with solid planning, so manage your time carefully. 2. Excellent Grammar . Needless to say, English grammar can be difficult and complex; even the best scholars take many years before they have a command of the major points of good grammar. Take the time to learn the major and minor points of good grammar. Spend time practicing writing and seek detailed feedback from professors. Take advantage of the Writing Center on campus if you need help. Proper punctuation and good proofreading skills can significantly improve academic writing [see sub-tab for proofreading you paper ]. Refer to these three basic resources to help your grammar and writing skills: A good writing reference book, such as, Strunk and White\u2019s book, The Elements of Style or the St. Martin's Handbook ; A college-level dictionary, such as, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary ; The latest edition of Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form . 3. Consistent Stylistic Approach . Whether your professor expresses a preference to use MLA, APA or the Chicago Manual of Style or not, choose one style manual and stick to it. Each of these style manuals provide rules on how to write out numbers, references, citations, footnotes, and lists. Consistent adherence to a style of writing helps with the narrative flow of your paper and improves its readability. Note that some disciplines require a particular style [e.g., education uses APA] so as you write more papers within your major, your familiarity with it will improve. II. Evaluating Quality of Writing A useful approach for evaluating the quality of your academic writing is to consider the following issues from the perspective of the reader. While proofreading your final draft, critically assess the following elements in your writing. It is shaped around one clear research problem, and it explains what that problem is from the outset. Your paper tells the reader why the problem is important and why people should know about it. You have accurately and thoroughly informed the reader what has already been published about this problem or others related to it and noted important gaps in the research. You have provided evidence to support your argument that the reader finds convincing. The paper includes a description of how and why particular evidence was collected and analyzed, and why specific theoretical arguments or concepts were used. The paper is made up of paragraphs, each containing only one controlling idea. You indicate how each section of the paper addresses the research problem. You have considered counter-arguments or counter-examples where they are relevant. Arguments, evidence, and their significance have been presented in the conclusion. Limitations of your research have been explained as evidence of the potential need for further study. The narrative flows in a clear, accurate, and well-organized way.

This choice in focus is achieved with the use of either the active or the passive voice. When you want your readers to focus on the \"doer\" of an action, you can make the \"doer\"' the subject of the sentence and use the active form of the verb. When you want readers to focus on the person, place, or thing affected by the action, or the action itself, you can make the effect or the action the subject of the sentence by using the passive form of the verb. Often in academic writing, scholars don't want to focus on who is doing an action, but on who is receiving or experiencing the consequences of that action. The passive voice is useful in academic writing because it allows writers to highlight the most important participants or events within sentences by placing them at the beginning of the sentence. Use the passive voice when: You want to focus on the person, place, or thing affected by the action, or the action itself; It is not important who or what did the action; You want to be impersonal or more formal. Form the passive voice by: Turning the object of the active sentence into the subject of the passive sentence. Changing the verb to a passive form by adding the appropriate form of the verb \"to be\" and the past participle of the main verb. NOTE: Consult with your professor about using the passive voice before submitting your research paper. Some strongly discourage its use! Active and Passive Voice. The Writing Lab and The OWL.

As such, your study must be able to stand alone without the appendices, and the paper must contain all information including tables, diagrams, and results necessary to understand the research problem. The key point to remember when including an appendix or appendices is that the information is non-essential; if it were removed, the reader would still be able to comprehend the significance, validity , and implications of your research. It is appropriate to include appendices for the following reasons: Including this material in the body of the paper that would render it poorly structured or interrupt the narrative flow; Information is too lengthy and detailed to be easily summarized in the body of the paper; Inclusion of helpful, supporting, or useful material would otherwise distract the reader from the main content of the paper; Provides relevant information or data that is more easily understood or analyzed in a self-contained section of the paper; Can be used when there are constraints placed on the length of your paper; and, Provides a place to further demonstrate your understanding of the research problem by giving additional details about a new or innovative method, technical details, or design protocols.

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 General Points to Consider When considering whether to include content in an appendix, keep in mind the following: It is usually good practice to include your raw data in an appendix, laying it out in a clear format so the reader can re-check your results. Another option if you have a large amount of raw data is to consider placing it online [e.g., on a Google drive] and note that this is the appendix to your research paper. Any tables and figures included in the appendix should be numbered as a separate sequence from the main paper . Remember that appendices contain non-essential information that, if removed, would not diminish a reader's ability to understand the research problem being investigated. This is why non-textual elements should not carry over the sequential numbering of non-textual elements in the body of your paper. If you have more than three appendices, consider listing them on a separate page in the table of contents . This will help the reader know what information is included in the appendices. Note that some works list appendices in the table of contents before the first chapter while other styles list the appendices after the conclusion but before your references. Consult with your professor to confirm if there is a preferred approach. The appendix can be a good place to put maps, photographs, diagrams, and other images , if you feel that it will help the reader to understand the content of your paper, while keeping in mind the study should be understood without them. An appendix should be streamlined and not loaded with a lot information . If you have a very long and complex appendix, it is a good idea to break it down into separate appendices, allowing the reader to find relevant information quickly as the information is covered in the body of the paper. II.\u00a0 Content Never include an appendix that isn\u2019t referred to in the text . All appendices should be summarized in your paper where it is relevant to the content. Appendices should also be arranged sequentially by the order they were first referenced in the text [i.e., Appendix 1 should not refer to text on page eight of your paper and Appendix 2 relate to text on page six]. There are very few rules regarding what type of material can be included in an appendix, but here are some common examples: Correspondence -- if your research included collaborations with others or outreach to others, then correspondence in the form of letters, memorandums, or copies of emails from those you interacted with could be included. Interview Transcripts -- in qualitative research, interviewing respondents is often used to gather information. The full transcript from an interview is important so the reader can read the entire dialog between researcher and respondent. The interview protocol [list of questions] should also be included. Non-textual elements -- as noted above, if there are a lot of non-textual items, such as, figures, tables, maps, charts, photographs, drawings, or graphs, think about highlighting examples in the text of the paper but include the remainder in an appendix. Questionnaires or surveys -- this is a common form of data gathering. Always include the survey instrument or questionnaires in an appendix so the reader understands not only the questions asked but the sequence in which they were asked. Include all variations of the instruments as well if different items were sent to different groups [e.g., those given to teachers and those given to administrators] . Raw statistical data \u2013 this can include any numerical data that is too lengthy to include in charts or tables in its entirety within the text. This is important because the entire source of data should be included even if you are referring to only certain parts of a chart or table in the text of your paper. Research instruments -- if you used a camera, or a recorder, or some other device to gather information and it is important for the reader to understand how, when, and/or where that device was used. Sample calculations \u2013 this can include quantitative research formulas or detailed descriptions of how calculations were used to determine relationships and significance. NOTE: Appendices should not be a dumping ground for information. Do not include vague or irrelevant information in an appendix; this additional information will not help the reader\u2019s overall understanding and interpretation of your research and may only distract the reader from understanding the significance of your overall study. ANOTHER NOTE : Appendices are intended to provide supplementary information that you have gathered or created; it is not intended to replicate or provide a copy of the work of others. For example, if you need to contrast the techniques of analysis used by other authors with your own method of analysis, summarize that information, and cite to the original work. In this case, a citation to the original work is sufficient enough to lead the reader to where you got the information. You do not need to provide a copy of this in an appendix. III.\u00a0 Format Here are some general guideline on how to format appendices . If needed, consult the writing style guide [e.g., APA, MLS, Chicago] your professor wants you to use for more detail: Appendices may precede or follow your list of references. Each appendix begins on a new page. The order they are presented is dictated by the order they are mentioned in the text of your research paper. The heading should be \"Appendix,\" followed by a letter or number [e.g., \"Appendix A\" or \"Appendix 1\"], centered and written in bold type. If there is a table of contents, the appendices must be listed. The page number(s) of the appendix/appendices will continue on with the numbering from the last page of the text. Appendices.

If you have a lot of raw data or information that is difficult to present in textual form, consider uploading it to an online site. This prevents your paper from having a large and unwieldy set of appendices and it supports a growing movement within academe to make data more freely available for re-analysis. If you do create an online portal to your data, note it prominently in your paper with the correct URL and access procedures if it is a secured site. Piwowar, Heather A., Roger S. Day, and Douglas B.

            "box_content": "An allegation of plagiarism is intent-neutral . In other words, because the reader cannot discern whether the absence of a citation was done deliberately or you simply forgot to add a citation, it is important to proofread your paper before you submit it to ensure you have listed all sources used during your research. This is also why it is important to keep track of everything you have used during the course of writing your paper so you can easily assess whether all your sources have been cited properly. With this in mind, credit must be given when using one of the following in your own research paper: Another person's idea, opinion, or theory; Any facts, statistics, graphs, drawings, or other non-textual elements used or that you adapted from another source; Any pieces of information that are not common knowledge; Quotations of another person's actual spoken or written words; or Paraphrase of another person's spoken or written words. To introduce students to the process of citing other people's work, the USC Libraries have created a useful online tutorial on avoiding plagiarism . It describes what constitutes plagiarism and offers helpful advice on how to properly cite sources. In addition, the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards has also published, \"Trojan Integrity: A Guide for Avoiding Plagiarism.\" This guide provides a comprehensive explanation for how to defend yourself against allegations of violating the university's policy on academic integrity. If you have any doubts about whether to cite a particular source concerning an argument or statement made in your paper, protect yourself by citing the source or sources that helps the reader determine the validity of your work. Note that not citing a source not only raises concerns about the academic integrity of your paper, but it also tells the reader that you did not conduct an effective or thorough review of the literature in support of examining the research problem. It also inhibits the reader's ability to review the cited source to obtain further information about what is being discussed in your paper. Academic Integrity. The Writing Center.

It generally supports the question, what did we know about this topic before I did this study? Sufficient background information helps your reader determine if you have a basic understanding of the research problem being investigated and promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and findings. This information provides the reader with the essential context needed to understand the research problem and its significance before moving on to the literature review. Depending on the problem being studied, forms of contextualization that may be needed in order to better understand its significance. This can include describing one or more of the following contexts: Cultural -- placed within the learned behavior of specific groups of people. Economic -- of or relating to systems of production and management of material wealth and/or business activities. Gender -- located within the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with being male or female. Historical -- the time in which something takes place or was created and how that influences how you interpret it. Interdisciplinary -- explanation of theories, concepts, ideas, or methodologies borrowed from other disciplines applied to the research problem rooted in a discipline other than the discipline where your paper resides. Philosophical -- clarification of the essential nature of being or of phenomena as it relates to the research problem. Physical/Spatial -- reflects the space around something and how that influences how you see it. Political -- concerns the environment in which something is produced indicating it's public purpose or agenda. Social -- the environment of people that surrounds something's creation or intended audience, reflecting how the people around something use and interpret it. Temporal -- reflects issues or events of, relating to, or limited by time. Background information can also include summaries of important, relevant research studies . This is particularly important if there is an essential or groundbreaking study about the research problem or a key study that refutes or supports your thesis. The key is to summarize for the reader what is known about the specific research problem before you conduct the analysis. This is accomplished with a general summary of the foundational research literature [with citations] that document findings that inform your study's aims and objectives. NOTE: Research studies cited as part of the background information of your introduction should not include very specific, lengthy explanations. This should be discussed in greater detail in your literature review section. Background of the Problem Section: What do you Need to Consider? Anonymous. Harvard University; Hopkins, Will G.

            "box_content": "Providing background information in the introduction of a research paper serves as a bridge that links the reader to the essential topic of your study . Precisely how long and in-depth this bridge should be is largely dependent upon how much information you think the reader will need to know in order to fully understand the problem being discussed and to appreciate why the issues you are investigating are important. From another perspective, the length and detail of background information also depends on the degree to which you need to demonstrate to your professor how much you understand the research problem. Keep this in mind because providing pertinent background information can be an effective way to demonstrate that you have a clear grasp of key issues and concepts underpinning your overall study. The structure and writing style of your background information can vary depending upon the complexity of your research and/or the nature of the assignment. Given this, here are some questions to consider while writing this part of your introduction : Are there concepts, terms, theories, or ideas that may be unfamiliar to the reader and, thus, require additional explanation? Are there historical elements that need to be explored in order to provide needed context, to highlight specific people, issues, or events, or to lay a foundation for understanding the emergence of a current issue or event? Are there theories, concepts, or ideas borrowed from other disciplines or academic traditions that may be unfamiliar to the reader and therefore require further explanation? Is the research study unusual in a way that requires additional explanation, such as, 1) your study uses a method of analysis never applied before; 2) your study investigates a very esoteric or complex research problem; 3) your study introduces new or unique variables that need to be taken into account ; or, 4) your study relies upon analyzing unique texts or documents, such as, archival materials or primary documents like diaries or personal letters that do not represent the established body of source literature on the topic? Almost all introductions to a research problem require some contextualizing, but the scope and breadth of background information varies depending on your assumption about the reader's level of prior knowledge . However, despite this assessment, background information should be brief and succinct; save any elaboration of critical points or in-depth discussion of key issues for the literature review section of your paper.

The goal when writing any paper is to choose a research problem that is focused and time-limited. However, your starting point should not be so narrowly defined that you unnecessarily constrict your opportunity to investigate the topic thoroughly. A research problem that is too narrowly defined leads to any of the following problems : You can't find enough information and what you do find is tangential or irrelevant. You find information that is so specific that it can't lead to any significant conclusions. Your sources cover so few ideas that you can't expand them into a significant paper. The research problem is so case specific that it limits opportunities to generalize or apply the results to other contexts. The significance of the research problem is limited to only a very small, unique population. Ravitch, Sharon M. and Matthew Riggan. Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks Guide Research .

If this happens, don't immediately abandon your efforts to investigate the problem because it could very well be an excellent topic of study. A good way to begin is to look for parallels and opportunities for broader associations that apply to the initial research problem. A strategy for doing this is to ask yourself the basic six questions of who, what, where, when, how, and why. Here is an example of how to apply the six questions strategy to broadening your topic. Let's use the research topic of how to investigate ways to improve trade relations between Peru and Bolivia as an example. Ask yourself: Who? -- are there other countries involved in the relations between these two countries that might want to challenge or encourage this relationship? Are there particular individuals or special interest groups [e.g., politicians, union leaders, etc.] promoting trade relations or trying to inhibit it? [remember to ask either the individual who question, the collective who question, or the institutional who question]. What? -- what are the specific trading commodities you are examining? Are there commodities not currently traded between Peru and Bolivia that could be? What commodities are being traded but should be traded in greater volume? What barriers exist that may help or hinder the import-exports of specific commodities? Where? -- where are examples of other bi-lateral trade agreements that could model the potential for closer trade relations between Peru and Bolivia? Where are the benefits most likely to be felt within each country? Note that the question of where can also relate to specific spatial and geographical issues, such as, are there any areas impeding transportation of goods in the region? When? -- how long have these countries had or not had trade relations? How far into the future might a trade relationship last given other factors? The question of when can relate to past issues as well as future areas of interest. How? -- how might Peru and Bolivia forge these ties in relation to, for example, long-standing internal conflicts within each country? Note that the how question can also be framed as, \"In what way might....\" [e.g., In what way might improved trade relations lead to other forms of economic exchanges between the two countries?]. Why? -- what advantages can each country gain by pursuing active trade relations? Why might other countries be concerned about closer ties between these two countries? Asking why can illuminate the \" So What? \" question applied to your topic and, thus, provide a means of assessing significance. Reflecting upon these six questions during your initial review of the literature can help you formulate ways to expand the parameters of your initial research problem, providing an opportunity to identify new avenues of investigation and centering your study around gaps in the literature when answers to questions cannot be found. Once you've identified additional directions in which to proceed with your topic, you can try narrowing it down again, if needed. NOTE: Do not determine on your own that a research problem is too narrowly defined . Always consult with a librarian before making this assumption because librarians are experts in finding information and interpreting it in relation to a research problem. As such, they can help guide you to undiscovered research or suggest ways to design a broader analysis of your research problem using resources you did not even know existed. Booth, Wayne C.

            "box_content": "The title is the part of a paper that is read the most, and it is usually read first . It is, therefore, the most important element that defines the research study. With this in mind, avoid the following when creating a title: If the title is too long, this usually indicates there are too many unnecessary words. Avoid language, such as, \"A Study to Investigate the...,\" or \"An Examination of the....\" These phrases are obvious and generally superfluous unless they are necessary to covey the scope, intent, or type of a study. On the other hand, a title which is too short often uses words which are too broad and, thus, does not tell the reader what is being studied. For example, a paper with the title, \"African Politics\" is so non-specific the title could be the title of a book and so ambiguous that it could refer to anything associated with politics in Africa. A good title should provide information about the focus and/or scope of your research study. In academic writing, catchy phrases or non-specific language may be used, but only if it's within the context of the study [e.g., \"Fair and Impartial Jury--Catch as Catch Can\"]. However, in most cases, you should avoid including words or phrases that do not help the reader understand the purpose of your paper. Academic writing is a serious and deliberate endeavor. Avoid using humorous or clever journalistic styles of phrasing when creating the title to your paper. Journalistic headlines often use emotional adjectives [e.g., incredible, amazing, effortless] to highlight a problem experienced by the reader or use \"trigger words\" or interrogative words like how, what, when, or why to persuade people to read the article or click on a link. These approaches are viewed as counter-productive in academic writing. A reader does not need clever or humorous titles to catch their attention because the act of reading research is assumed to be deliberate based on a desire to learn and improve understanding of the problem. In addition, a humorous title can merely detract from the seriousness and authority of your research. Unlike everywhere else in a college-level social sciences research paper [except when using direct quotes in the text], titles do not have to adhere to rigid grammatical or stylistic standards. For example, it could be appropriate to begin a title with a coordinating conjunction [i.e., and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet] if it makes sense to do so and does not detract from the purpose of the study [e.g., \"Yet Another Look at Mutual Fund Tournaments\"] or beginning the title with an inflected form of a verb such as those ending in -ing [e.g., \"Assessing the Political Landscape: Structure, Cognition, and Power in Organizations\"].

            "box_content": "The following parameters can be used to help you formulate a suitable research paper title: The purpose of the research The scope of the research The narrative tone of the paper [typically defined by the type of the research] The methods used to study the problem The initial aim of a title is to capture the reader\u2019s attention and to highlight the research problem under investigation. Create a Working Title Typically, the final title you submit to your professor is created after the research is complete so that the title accurately captures what has been done . The working title should be developed early in the research process because it can help anchor the focus of the study in much the same way the research problem does. Referring back to the working title can help you reorient yourself back to the main purpose of the study if you find yourself drifting off on a tangent while writing. The Final Title Effective titles in research papers have several characteristics that reflect general principles of academic writing. Indicate accurately the subject and scope of the study, Rarely use abbreviations or acronyms unless they are commonly known, Use words that create a positive impression and stimulate reader interest, Use current nomenclature from the field of study, Identify key variables, both dependent and independent, Reveal how the paper will be organized, Suggest a relationship between variables which supports the major hypothesis, Is limited to 5 to 15 substantive words, Does not include redundant phrasing, such as, \"A Study of,\" \"An Analysis of\" or similar constructions, Takes the form of a question or declarative statement, If you use a quote as part of the title, the source of the quote is cited [usually using an asterisk and footnote], Use correct grammar and capitalization with all first words and last words capitalized, including the first word of a subtitle. All nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that appear between the first and last words of the title are also capitalized, and Rarely uses an exclamation mark at the end of the title. The Subtitle Subtitles are frequently used in social sciences research papers because it helps the reader understand the scope of the study in relation to how it was designed to address the research problem. Think about what type of subtitle listed below reflects the overall approach to your study and whether you believe a subtitle is needed to emphasize the investigative parameters of your research. 1. Explains or provides additional context , e.g., \"Linguistic Ethnography and the Study of Welfare Institutions as a Flow of Social Practices: The Case of Residential Child Care Institutions as Paradoxical Institutions.\" [Palomares, Manuel and David Poveda. Text & Talk: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Language, Discourse and Communication Studies 30 (January 2010): 193-212] 2. Adds substance to a literary, provocative, or imaginative title or quote , e.g., \"Listen to What I Say, Not How I Vote\": Congressional Support for the President in Washington and at Home.\" [Grose, Christian R. and Keesha M. Middlemass. Social Science Quarterly 91 (March 2010): 143-167] 3. Qualifies the geographic scope of the research , e.g., \"The Geopolitics of the Eastern Border of the European Union: The Case of Romania-Moldova-Ukraine.\" [Marcu, Silvia. Geopolitics 14 (August 2009): 409-432] 4. Qualifies the temporal scope of the research , e.g., \"A Comparison of the Progressive Era and the Depression Years: Societal Influences on Predictions of the Future of the Library, 1895-1940.\" [Grossman, Hal B. Libraries & the Cultural Record 46 (2011): 102-128] 5. Focuses on investigating the ideas, theories, or work of a particular individual , e.g., \"A Deliberative Conception of Politics: How Francesco Saverio Merlino Related Anarchy and Democracy.\" [La Torre, Massimo. Sociologia del Diritto 28 (January 2001): 75 - 98] 6. Identifies the methodology used , e.g. \"Student Activism of the 1960s Revisited: A Multivariate Analysis Research Note.\" [Aron, William S. Social Forces 52 (March 1974): 408-414] 7. Defines the overarching technique for analyzing the research problem , e.g., \"Explaining Territorial Change in Federal Democracies: A Comparative Historical Institutionalist Approach.\" [ Tillin, Louise. Political Studies 63 (August 2015): 626-641. With these examples in mind, think about what type of subtitle reflects the overall approach to your study.

            "box_content": "The \"Replication Crisis\" in the Social Sciences and Searching Cited By References The replication crisis in academe refers to research showing that findings published in top journals often cannot be replicated in subsequent studies . The ability to replicate research is a core principle of the scientific method of discovery and verification. Replicating the research of prior studies increases the probability and, by extension, the confidence one has that a given finding is valid in a real world setting or is reliably applicable to professional practice. The problem, as noted by Prochazka, Fedoseeva, and Houdek (2021) is that, \u201c\u2026the replication crisis in the social sciences has showed that many of the published effects has been found by chance or due to the specific conditions of a study\u2026Therefore, an effect found in a single study should be viewed with caution.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. Nonreplicable studies tend to be cited more frequently than studies that have been successfully replicated . One reason for this, according to researchers, is that authors are often motivated to use an unorthodox approaches to studying a problem. This is because methodological unorthodoxy is often rewarded [intentionally or not] by institutions of higher education and journal publishers. Replicating another person\u2019s research doesn\u2019t garner the same attention towards obtaining prestigious grant funding or gaining tenure for the author as a \u201cunique\u201d study. As a result, this tendency can distort the total number count of citations in some studies, making it more difficult to discern a truly groundbreaking study from a \u201cfailed\u201d nonreplicable study that has been cited simply because it\u2019s found to be unique in some way. To address this issue when searching cited by references, review studies that cite the original study shortly after it was published. Are authors attempting to replicate the research? If so, are they doing so successfully and building on this research or are they simply citing the work in their literature review section. In the end however, don't get too caught up in this \"crisis\"; always keep in mind that the purpose of citation tracking is to build a body of knowledge that supports investigating the research problem.

However, citation tracking is not a linear process, but rather, an iterative process comprising of multi-layered paths of discovery . Not only can you identify citations that directly cite the original study, but those studies may also have cited by references that can be reviewed, then those studies can have cited by references that can be searched, and so on. While this process of traveling through the literature by reviewing multiple layers of cited by references can be useful in discovering new sources that perhaps would have been hidden otherwise, one can easily get lost in the process. This is particularly true with following cited by references in Google Scholar because the content is so immense. A good strategy for not getting lost is to note a promising record that cites a source that has cited the original source so you can go back and review the cited by references of that study without worrying about losing track of where you are in the initial review process.

            "box_content": "Citation tracking can facilitate the review and evaluation of literature pertinent to a research problem for the following reasons: It can be an effective way of using a frequently cited \"landmark\" or groundbreaking article to find more recent, related articles that cite the original work. It can be an effective strategy of identifying leading scholars in a particular area of study either by how frequently their work has been cited or by scholars who have subsequently cited the original work. It can be a useful means for evaluating a study's impact within a particular discipline based upon the number of times a research study has been cited by others. A frequently cited study may indicate that the research findings are unique, groundbreaking, or, in some way, controversial. It can be an effective way to locate studies that critique or challenge groundbreaking research , which is important if you are seeking research to support your attempt to challenge long-held assumptions or to offer evidence that existing studies do not adequately address the research problem. It can be an effective means of determining the interdisciplinary value of a particular study because you can identify the number of subsequent citations in publications by scholars in other disciplines or fields of study. Studies that have been cited in a variety of disciplines is also a strong indication of the research study's overall impact throughout the social sciences [and perhaps beyond]. Keep in mind the following points when tracking citations: Authors do not always use the same name throughout their careers [e.g., Jane Anne Smith or Jane A. Smith] so be sure you work from a complete and accurate list of an author's publications. A thorough literature review of an author should reveal any variations in their name. The Web of Science citation database uses the APA [American Psychological Association] style for citing authors [last name and first initial only], so a J Smith could be John, Jeff, Jane, Julie, Jason, etc. Be sure to truncate the initial [adding an asterisk *] to see a more complete list of authors, then locate a record on a topic you know the author writes about and click on that author to exclude articles written by other J Smith's. Fortunately, the database indexes more than the first author of a paper so if a second or third author has an uncommon name, you can search the unusual name instead of using an author's common name. Citation services are primarily based on selected journal literature . If the author is cited in books, organizational research reports, government documents, or non-scholarly publications, the usefulness of your citation analysis is limited. In addition, citation databases such as Web of Science have limited coverage of articles published in scholarly open-access journals [peer-reviewed journals published freely on the web], although this problem is slowly improving. In this case, be sure to check the \"cited by\" references in Google Scholar as it often includes citations found in other publications besides scholarly journals. Google Scholar and most library research databases do an inadequate job citing to non-English language sources . English is generally considered the universal language of scholarly research. However, this privileges English-born publications at the expense of research published in other languages, particularly if the study is written using non-Roman characters [e.g., Korean, Hindi, Russian, etc.]. This deficiency is slowly getting better as private database vendors and, in particular Google Scholar , begin to include more non-English language studies in their systems. Nevertheless, always keep in mind that the number of citations to an original study may not represent its true impact among scholars in non-English speaking regions of the world. If needed, contact a librarian for help identifying foreign language studies that may cite the original work.

            "box_title": "Interpreting \"Cited By\" References in Databases",
            "box_content": "Records found while searching Google Scholar and many library databases often include a \"cited by\" reference followed by a number [e.g., Cited by 143]. This number indicates, in general, how many times a study has been subsequently cited by other authors in other publications [I say \"in general\" because the total may include duplicate records, such as, an author citing their own work or citations to same study in multiple types of publications]. However, the total number of times a journal article or other publication has been cited after it was published is more nuanced than just the number count . When reviewing \"cited by\" references as part of your review of the literature, consider the following interpretive principles that will help you determine if the source should be examined more carefully. An item that is cited many times indicates impact, but it does not indicate value . Citations are value-neutral. A study may be cited frequently because it added important new knowledge to understanding the research problem. However, a study could also be cited frequently because subsequent research found the original study to be poorly designed or the author employed an imprecise methodological approach or the conclusions were speculative and perhaps misleading [also note Another Citing Tip below] . Use the date limitation function to review a sample of recent studies that have referenced the work and assess how the original source is currently being described. Based on this, determine how the frequently cited source may be relevant to your own research. Note that if subsequent research shows the original study to be flawed, you can reference the study in your paper as an example of why further research is needed. A source that is frequently cited is a subjective assessment of impact, not an objective measurement or formal statistical calculation . Should a study published ten years ago with 800 cited by references be considered a frequently cited source? How about a study published ten years ago that has over 2,000 cited by references? Is that source better than the other in terms of assessing whether it should be reviewed in detail? What about a source with only 120 cited by references? There are a variety of factors that contribute to whether a source has been cited frequently or not. Ultimately, the number of cited by references is relevant to you only in relation to the research problem being investigated. If the study directly informs your understanding of the topic, you should review the cited by references. If there are a manageable number, review them all; if there is a large number of references, focus on reviewing the most recently published sources. Once published, a recently published study can become cited by other authors very quickly . This is particularly the case if the study was published in a core research journal read by all the leading scholars of the discipline, it was published in a source read by researchers from a variety of disciplines, the study was written by a well-known and preeminent scholar, or the research has been written about in national newspapers and magazines, discussed on television news programs, or even talked about and shared on social media sites. A way to discern impact over time is to count the number of recent citations to a study [e.g., the last five years]. If the study has been cited only a few times, this likely indicate that the study's impact is waning and scholars have moved on. However,.... A study may be considered foundational or groundbreaking if it continues to be cited frequently in the most recently published literature on the topic . A source published many years ago that authors continue to cite can indicate the research was the first to advance new knowledge and, therefore, the study either contributed significantly to understanding the research problem or the findings' ability to inform practice was particularly important or innovative. In most cases, there is an expectation that a study interpreted to be foundational or groundbreaking should be cited as the basis for supporting your overall review and assessment of prior research or to document when a research problem first emerged. Review the cited by references of relevant resources to determine a study's impact across disciplines . Cross-disciplinary cited by references can be an important indicator of a study's overall impact if it has been referenced in a variety of different investigative contexts or domains of applied practice. Consider reviewing these sources in more detail in support of your own review of the literature. Do this by comparing the disciplinary focus of the original source in relation to the disciplinary focus of the cited by references. For example, an article originally published in a social work journal that is cited in journals from sociology, education, and psychology demonstrates impact beyond the field of social work. Examine whether the source is referenced alone or always grouped with other sources . This act of interpretation can be challenging, but, in general, a study that is consistently cited with other sources, though rarely cited as a stand-alone study, may indicate that the research is not unique or distinctive in a way that stands out from the overall domain of prior research about the topic. For example, you find that Smith's original study is always referenced in relation to other authors doing similar work. This should not be viewed necessarily as negative because many scholars may have investigated a specific research problem. However, in interpreting the relevance of a particular source in relation to your own research, sources that have never been cited as a stand-alone source of prior research can be an additional way of determining their overall impact. Cited by references listed in the first few years after the original study was published can also add important insights . For example, the earliest studies to cite an original work can highlight the initial interests and potential biases of scholars at the time, they can reflect a growing awareness of the need to critically examine the research problem, they can highlight the application of prevailing theories and ideas at the time, and the earliest published studies citing the original source can help illuminate key intellectual struggles among scholars as they attempt to make sense of an emerging problem. All or any of these factors can help contextualize the way in which you use prior research to write about the background and history of a topic in the introduction or literature review sections of your paper.

            "page_title": "Common Grammar Mistakes",
            "box_title": "Avoid These Common Grammar Mistakes!",
            "box_content": "Cartoonist Doug Larson once observed: \"If the English language made any sense, a catastrophe would be an apostrophe with fur\" [ The Quotations Page ]. Because the English language has complicated grammar and usage rules and most of those rules have multiple exceptions in how they are applied, there are many online sites that discuss how to avoid mistakes in grammar and word usage. Here are a few that may be particularly helpful: English Grammar Lingua Franca Column , Chronicle of Higher Education Plain Language.gov Listed below are the most common mistakes that are made by writers and, thus, the ones you should focus on locating and removing while proofreading your research paper. Affect / effect -- welcome to what I consider to be the most confusing aspect in the English language. \"Effect\" is most often a noun and generally means \u201ca result.\u201d However, \"effect\" can be used as a verb that essentially means \"to bring about,\" or \"to accomplish.\" The word \"affect\" is almost always a verb and generally means \"to influence.\" However, affect can be used as a noun when you're talking about the mood that someone appears to have. [Ugh!] Apostrophes -- the position of an apostrophe depends upon whether the noun is singular or plural. For singular words, add an \"s\" to the end, even if the final letter is an \"s.\" For contractions, replace missing letters with an apostrophe; but remember that it is where the letters no longer are, which is not always where the words are joined [e.g., \"is not\" and \"isn't\"]. Note that contractions are rarely used in scholarly writing. Capitalization -- a person\u2019s title is capitalized when it precedes the name and, thus, is seen as part of the name [e.g., President Zachary Taylor]; once the title occurs, further references to the person holding the title appear in lowercase [e.g., the president]. For groups or organizations, the name is capitalized when it is the full name [e.g., the United States Department of Justice]; further references should be written in lowercase [e.g., the department]. In general, the use of capital letters should be minimized as much as possible. Colorless verbs and bland adjectives \u2013- passive voice, use of the to be verb, is a lost opportunity to use a more interesting and accurate verb when you can. Adjectives can also be used very specifically to add to the sentence. Try to avoid generic or bland adjectives and be specific. Use adjectives that add to the meaning of the sentence. Comma splices -- a comma splice is the incorrect use of a comma to connect two independent clauses (an independent clause is a phrase that is grammatically and conceptually complete: that is, it can stand on its own as a sentence). To correct the comma splice, you can: replace the comma with a period, forming two sentences; replace the comma with a semicolon; or, join the two clauses with a conjunction such as \"and,\" \"because,\" \"but,\" etc. Compared with vs. compared to -- compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as essentially of a different order; compare with is mainly to point out differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order [e.g., life has been compared to a journey; Congress may be compared with the British Parliament]. Confusing singular possessive and plural nouns \u2013- singular possessive nouns always take an apostrophe, with few exceptions, and plural nouns never take an apostrophe. Omitting an apostrophe or adding one where it does not belong makes the sentence unclear. Coordinating conjunctions -- words, such as \"but,\" \"and,\" \"yet,\" join grammatically similar elements [i.e., two nouns, two verbs, two modifiers, two independent clauses]. Be sure that the elements they join are equal in importance and in structure. Dangling participial -- a participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject of the sentence. Dropped commas around clauses \u2013-place commas around words, phrases, or clauses that interrupt a sentence. Do not use commas around restrictive clauses, which provide essential information about the subject of the sentence. The Existential \"this\" -- always include a referent with \"this,\" such as \"this theory...\" or \"this approach to understanding the....\" With no referent, \"this\" can confuse the reader. The Existential \"it\" -- the \"existential it\" gives no reference for what \"it\" is. Be specific! Its / it's --\"its\" is the possessive form of \"it.\" \"It's\" is the contraction of \"it is\" or \"it has.\" They are not interchangeable and the latter should be avoided in scholarly writing. Fewer / Less -- if you can count it, then use the word fewer; if you cannot count it, use the word less. Interrupting clause \u2013- this clause or phrase interrupts a sentence, such as, \"however.\" Place a comma on either side of the interrupting clause. An interrupting clause should generally be avoided in academic writing. Know your non-restrictive clauses \u2013- this clause or phrase modifies the subject of the sentence, but it is not essential to understanding the sentence. The word \u201cwhich\u201d is the relative pronoun usually used to introduce the nonrestrictive clause. Know your restrictive clauses \u2013- this clause limits the meaning of the nouns it modifies. The restrictive clause introduces information that is essential to understanding the meaning of the sentence. The word \u201cthat\u201d is the relative pronoun normally used to introduce this clause. Without this clause or phrase, the meaning of the sentence changes. Literally -- this word means that exactly what you say is true, no metaphors or analogies. Be aware of this if you are using \"literally\" to describe something. The term literally should never be applied to subjective expressions [i.e., \"literally the most comfortable meeting\"] or to imprecise measurements [i.e., \"literally dozens of protesters\"]. Lonely quotes \u2013- unlike in journalistic writing, quotes in scholarly writing cannot stand on their own as a sentence. Integrate them into a paragraph. Misuse and abuse of semicolons \u2013- semicolons are used to separate two related independent clauses or to separate items in a list that contains commas. Do not abuse semicolons by using them often; they are best used sparingly. Overuse of unspecific determinates -- words such as \"super\" [as in super strong] or \"very\" [as in very strong], are unspecific determinates. How many/much is \"very\"? How incredibly awesome is super? If you ask ten people how cold, \"very cold\" is, you would get ten different answers. Academic writing should be precise, so eliminate as many unspecific determinants as possible. Semicolon usage -- a semicolon is most often used to separate two complete but closely related clauses. Consider the semicolon as marking a shorter pause than a period but a longer pause than a comma (this is easy to remember since a semicolon is the combination of a period and a comma). In the same way, semicolons are also used to separate complicated lists of three or more items. Sentence fragments \u2013- these occur when a dependent clause is punctuated as a complete sentence. Dependent clauses must be used together with an independent clause. Singular words that sound plural -- when using words like \"each,\" \"every,\" \"everybody,\" \"nobody,\" or \"anybody\" in a sentence, we're likely thinking about more than one person or thing. But all these words are grammatically singular: they refer to just one person or thing at a time. And unfortunately, if you change the verb to correct the grammar, you create a pedantic phrase like \"he or she\" or \"his or her.\" Split Infinitive -- an infinitive is the form of a verb that begins with \"to.\" Splitting an infinitive means placing another word or words between the \"to\" and the infinitive verb. This is considered incorrect by purists, but nowadays it is considered a matter of style rather than poor grammar. Nevertheless, in academic writing, it's best to avoid split infinitives. Subject/pronoun disagreement \u2013- there are two types of subject/pronoun disagreements. Shifts in number refer to the shifting between singular and plural in the same sentence. Be consistent. Shifts in person occurs when the person shifts within the sentence from first to second person, from second to third person, etc. That vs. which -- that clauses (called restrictive) are essential to the meaning of the sentence; which clauses (called nonrestrictive) merely add additional information. In general, most nonrestrictive clauses in academic writing are incorrect or superfluous. While proofreading, go on a \"which\" hunt and turn most of them into restrictive clauses. Also, \"that\" never follows a comma but \"which\" does. Verb Tense Agreement -- this refers to keeping the same tense [past, present, future] throughout a clause. Do not shift from one tense to another if the time for each action or event is the same. Note that, when referring to separate actions or events, the tenses may be different. Who / whom -- who is used as the subject of the clause it introduces; whom is used as the object of a preposition, as a direct object, or as an indirect object. A key to remembering which word to use is to simply substitute who or whom with a pronoun. If you can substitute he, she, we, or they in the clause, and it still sounds okay, then you know that who is the correct word to use. If, however, him, her, us, or them sounds more appropriate, then whom is the correct choice for the sentence. Attending to Grammar. Institute for Writing Rhetoric.

            "box_title": "Design Flaws to Avoid",
            "box_content": "The research design establishes the decision-making processes, conceptual structure of investigation, and methods of analysis used to address the central research problem of your study. Taking the time to develop a thorough research design helps to organize your thoughts, sets the boundaries of your study, maximizes the reliability of your findings, and avoids misleading or incomplete conclusions. Therefore, if any aspect of your research design is flawed or under-developed, the quality and reliability of your final results, as well as the overall value of your study, will be diminished. In no particular order, here are some common problems to avoid when designing a research study. Some are general issues you should think about as your organize your thoughts [e.g., developing a good research problem] while other issues must be explicitly addressed in your paper [e.g., describe study limitations]. Lack of Specificity -- do not describe the investigative aspects of your study in overly-broad generalities. Avoid using vague qualifiers, such as, extremely, very, entirely, completely, etc. It's important that you design a study that describes the process of investigation in clear and concise terms. Otherwise, the reader cannot be certain what you intend to do. Poorly Defined Research Problem -- the starting point of most new research in the social and behavioral sciences is to formulate a problem statement and begin the process of developing questions that address the problem. Your paper should outline and explicitly delimit the problem and state what you intend to investigate because this will determine what research design you will use [identifying the research problem always precedes choice of design]. Lack of Theoretical Framework -- the theoretical framework represents the conceptual foundation of your study. Therefore, your research design should include an explicit set of logically derived hypotheses, basic postulates, or assumptions that can be tested in relation to the research problem. More information about developing a theoretical framework can be found here . Significance -- the research design must include a clear answer to the \"So What?\" question. Be sure you clearly articulate why your study is important and how it contributes to the larger body of literature about the topic being investigated. Relationship between Past Research and Your Study -- do not simply offer a summary description of prior research. Your literature review should include an explicit statement linking the results of prior research to the research you are about to undertake. This can be done, for example, by identifying basic weaknesses in previous studies and how your study helps to fill this gap in knowledge. Contribution to the Field -- in placing your study within the context of prior research, don't just note that a gap exists; be clear in describing how your study contributes to, or possibly challenges, existing assumptions or findings. Provincialism -- this refers to designing a narrowly applied scope, geographical area, sampling, or method of analysis that restricts your ability to create meaningful outcomes and, by extension, obtaining results that are relevant and possibly transferable to understanding phenomena in other settings. Objectives, Hypotheses, or Questions -- your research design should include one or more questions or hypotheses that you are attempting to answer about the research problem underpinning your study. They should be clearly articulated and closely tied to the overall aims of your paper. Although there is no rule regarding the number of questions or hypotheses associated with a research problem, most studies in the social sciences address between one and five key questions. Poor Methodological Approach -- the design must include a well-developed and transparent plan for how you intend to collect or generate data and how it will be analyzed. Ensure that the method used to gather information for analysis is aligned with the topic of inquiry and the underlying research questions to be addressed. Proximity Sampling -- this refers to using a sample that is based not on the purpose of your study, but rather, is based on the proximity of a particular group of subjects. The units of analysis, whether they be persons, places, events, or things, must not be based solely on ease of access and convenience. Techniques or Instruments -- be clear in describing the techniques [e.g., semi-structured interviews] or instruments [e.g., questionnaire] used to gather data. Your research design should note how the technique or instrument will provide reasonably reliable data to answer the questions associated with the research problem. Statistical Treatment -- in quantitative studies, you must give a complete description of how you will organize the raw data for analysis. In most cases, this involves describing the data through the measures of central tendencies like mean, median, and mode that help the researcher explain how the data are concentrated and, thus, lead to meaningful interpretations of key trends or patterns found within the data. Vocabulary -- research often contains jargon and specialized language that the reader is presumably familiar with. However, avoid overuse of technical or pseudo-technical terminology. Problems with vocabulary also can refer to the use of popular terms, cliche's, or culture-specific language that is inappropriate for academic writing. More information about proper word usage can be found here . Ethical Dilemmas -- in the methods section of qualitative research studies, your design must document how you intend to minimize risk for participants [a.k.a., \"respondents\", \"human subjects\"] during stages of data gathering while, at the same time, still being able to adequately address the research problem. Failure to do so can lead the reader to question the validity and objectivity of your entire study. Limitations of Study -- all studies have limitations. Your research design should anticipate and explain the reasons why these limitations exist and clearly describe the extent of missing data. It is important to include a statement concerning what impact these limitations may have on the validity of your results and how you helped ameliorate the significance of these limitations.

            "box_title": "Detecting Bias",
            "box_content": "Detecting Bias Bias, whether done intentionally or not, occurs when a statement reflects a partiality, preference, or prejudice for or against an object, person, place, or idea. Listed below are problems to look for when determining if the source is biased. Availability Bias -- this is a tendency for people to overestimate probabilities of events related to memorable or dramatic occurrences [e.g., after 9/11, people took vacation by traveling by car rather than airplane even though, statistically, car travel is much more dangerous]. This form of bias in a research study can take the form of an example used to support author\u2019s argument or the design a case study focused around a particular event. Unless the purpose of the study is to illuminate new understanding around a memorable or dramatic occurrence, be critical of studies that use this type of measurement to examine a research problem. A seemingly mundane or uneventful occurrence can be just as valid in developing solutions to a problem or advancing new knowledge. Distortion or Stretching of the Facts -- this refers to the act of making issues, problems, or arguments appear more extreme by using misinformation or exaggerated and/or imprecise language to describe research outcomes [e.g., \u201cEveryone agreed the policy was a complete disaster.\u201d Who's everyone? How was data gathered to come to this conclusion? And, how does one specifically define something as a \"disaster\"? Is there sufficient evidence to support such a broad statement?]. Look for declarative statements that lack appropriate reference to supporting evidence or are follow up with detailed analysis. Flawed Research Design -- bias can enter the narrative as a result of a poorly designed study; this may include a claim or generalization about the findings based upon too small a sample, manipulating statistics, omitting contrary conclusions from other studies, or failing to recognize negative results [results that do not support the hypothesis]. Lack of Citations -- it is acceptable to issue a broad declarative statement if it is clearly supported and linked to evidence from your study [e.g., \"Testimony during Congressional hearings shows that the Department of Education is reluctant to act so teachers must do so\"]. This problem refers to statements or information presented as fact that does not include proper citation to a source or to sources that support the researcher's position, or that are not statements explicitly framed as the author's opinion. Misquoting a Source -- this is when an author rewords, paraphrases, or manipulates a statement, the information about a source is incomplete, or a quote is presented in such a way that it misleads or conveys a false impression. This is important when paraphrasing another author. If you cannot adequate summarize a specific statement, finding, or recommendation, use a direct quote to avoid any ambiguity. Persuasive or Inflammatory Language -- using words and phrases intended to elicit a positive or negative response from the reader or that leads the reader to arrive at a specific conclusion [e.g., referring to one group in an armed conflict as \u201cterrorists\u201d and the other group as \u201cpeace-loving\u201d]. Selective Facts -- taking information out of context or selectively choosing information that only supports the argument while omitting the overall context or vital supporting evidence. Statistical Survey Bias -- this can take several forms so, if data is presented in a study that was gathered by the author(s), examine it critically for the following possible biases: Measurement Error: this results from problems with the process by which data was gathered, such as, the use of leading questions that influence the response rate or that are biased toward what respondents believe is socially desirable because most people want to present themselves favorably. The only way to assess bias in these cases is to have access to the survey instrument used to gather data. Sample Size: increasing the number of a sample, for example the number of people interviewed, does not necessarily decrease bias, but look to see if the sample used is representative of the population under study to ensure that any generalizations or conclusions from the interpretation of the data is valid. Undercoverage: this refers to the method of data gathering that is a result of non-response to a survey because some subjects do not have the opportunity to participate. In looking at data, be sure to understand the percentage of non-responses to a survey or groups of people who were not included. Voluntary Response: this bias occurs when respondents to a survey are self-selected, resulting in an overrepresentation of individuals who have strong opinions [e.g., data from a radio call-in show]. Be an especially critical reader of web-based surveys about controversial topics if the author(s) have not indicated how they interpreted thew data from voluntary surveys. NOTE: The act of determining bias in scholarly research is also an act of constant self-reflection. Everyone has biases. Therefore, it is important that you minimize the influence of your own biases by approaching the assessment of another person's research introspectively and with a degree of self-awareness. ANOTHER NOTE: The idea of bias often carries negative connotations, even though the meaning of the term is not defined in that context. Be sure when you are evaluating a source that you do not automatically reject it as invalid if you detect bias. One way to do this is to substitute the idea of bias with the idea of perspective. Ask yourself, what type of perspective does this source bring to the investigation of the research problem? As Lesh points out, the goal of research is to engage with multiple sources for the purpose of acquiring multiple perspectives about the topic. As long as the source is rooted in fact-based evidence, you should not reject it as being biased, but rather, consider it as a potential source of perspective about the research problem. \"Availability Bias, Source Bias, and Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis.\" In Methods of Meta-Analysis: Correcting Error and Bias in Research Findings. 3rd Edition.

            "box_content": "The act of thinking critically about the validity and reliability of a research resource generally involves asking yourself a series of questions about the quality of both the item and the content of that item. Evaluating the Source Inquiring about the Author What are the author's credentials, such as, institutional affiliation [where he or she works], educational background, past writings, or experience? Is the book or article written on a topic in the author's area of expertise? Has your instructor mentioned this author? Have you seen the author's name cited in other sources or bibliographies? Is the author associated with a reputable institution or organization? What are the basic values or goals of that organization or institution? Inquiring about the Date of Publication When was the source published? Is the source current or out-of-date for your topic? Inquiring about the Edition or Revision Is this a first edition of this publication or not? Further editions usually indicate a source has been revised and updated to reflect changes in knowledge, to include prior omissions, and to better harmonize the contents with the intended needs of its readers. If you are using a web source, do the pages indicate last revision dates? Inquiring about the Publisher Note the publisher. If the source is published by a university press, it is likely to be scholarly. Although the fact that a publisher is reputable does not necessarily guarantee quality, it does show that the publisher has a high regard for the source being published [their reputation as an academic publisher relies on it]. Inquiring about the Title of Journal Is this a scholarly or a popular journal? This distinction is important because it indicates different levels of complexity in conveying ideas and the intended readership. Evaluating the Content Intended Audience What type of audience is the author addressing? Is the publication aimed at a specialized or a general audience? Is this source too elementary, too technical, too advanced, or just right for your needs? Objectivity Is the information covered considered to be fact, opinion, or propaganda? It is not always easy to separate fact from opinion. Facts can usually be verified; opinions, though they may be based on factual information, evolve from the interpretation of facts. Does the information appear to be valid and well-researched, or is it questionable and unsupported by evidence? Note errors or omissions. Are the ideas and arguments advanced more or less in line with other works you have read on the same topic? Coverage Does the work update or clarify prior knowledge, substantiate other materials you have read, or add new information? Does it extensively or only marginally cover your topic? Does it provide a balanced perspective? If the item in question does not meet this criteria, you should review enough sources to obtain a variety of viewpoints. Writing Style Is the publication organized logically? Are the main points clearly presented? Do you find the text easy to read, or is it stilted or choppy? Is the author's argument repetitive? Evaluative Reviews In the case of books, locate critical reviews of the work in a database such as ProQuest Multiple . Is the review positive? Is the book under review considered a valuable contribution to the field? Do reviewers agree on the value or attributes of the book or are there strong differences of opinion? Does the reviewer mention other books that might be better? If so, locate these sources for more information on your topic.

            "box_content": "Web Content Requires Additional Methods of Evaluation A report from the Stanford University Graduate School of Education found that students evaluating information that flows across social media channels or retrieved from online search engines like Google or Bing, have difficulty distinguishing advertisements from news articles or how to identity where the content came from. In general, the principles that guide your evaluation of print materials are the same that apply to evaluating online resources. However, unlike print materials that have certain features that help determine their scholarly integrity, the interactive and multimedia dynamics of online sources requires additional attention to the content in order to obtain confidence that what you are viewing is valid and credible. Additional things to look for when considering using an online resource: Source of the content is stated -- determine whether the content is original or borrowed, quoted, or imported from elsewhere. Note that content imported from another source via RSS feed can be difficult to identify, as this material can be incorporated into other content on the page without being appropriately labeled. Don't be fooled by an attractive, professional-looking presentation -- just because a site looks professional doesn't mean that it is. However, poorly organized web page designs or poorly written content is easy to recognize and can be a signal that you should carefully scrutinize the site's content. Site is currently being maintained -- check for last posting dates or last revised dates. Most scholarly websites show a date when the content was last posted or revised. Note that, if no date is indicated, this does not mean its content is invalid. However, it may indicate that the content is out-of-date and does not reflect current information about the topic. Links are relevant and appropriate, and are in working order -- a site with a lot of broken links is an indication of neglect and out-of-date content. Clearly states authorship -- if a site is produced anonymously, you cannot verify the legitimacy of its creator. Note that an author of a site can be either be a person or an organization. The site includes contact information -- if you have questions about the site, contact information is an important indicator that the site is well-maintained. Domain location in the site address (URL) is relevant to the focus of the material [e.g., .edu for educational or research materials; .org for non-profit organizations; .gov for government sites; .com for business sites]. Note that the domain is not necessarily a primary indicator of site content. For example, some authors post their content on blog or wiki platforms hosted by companies with .com addresses. Also note that the tilde (~) in the URL usually indicates a personal page. Evaluating Internet Information. Online Library Learning Center.

            "box_content": "Although an executive summary is similar to an abstract in that they both summarize the contents of a research study, there are several key differences. With research abstracts, the author's recommendations are rarely included, or if they are, they are implicit rather than explicit. Recommendations are generally not stated in academic abstracts because scholars operate in a discursive environment, where debates, discussions, and dialogs are meant to precede the implementation of any new research findings. The conceptual nature of much academic writing also means that recommendations arising from the findings are distributed widely and not easily or usefully encapsulated. Executive summaries are used mainly when a research study has been developed for an organizational partner, funding entity, or other external group that participated in the research . In such cases, the research report and executive summary are often written for policy makers outside of academe, while abstracts are written for the academic community. Professors, therefore, assign the writing of executive summaries so students can practice synthesizing and writing about the contents of comprehensive research studies for external stakeholder groups. When preparing to write, keep in mind that: An executive summary is not an abstract. An executive summary is not an introduction. An executive summary is not a preface. An executive summary is not a random collection of highlights. Christensen, Jay. Executive Summaries Complete The Report.

            "box_content": "Writing an Executive Summary Read the Entire Document This may go without saying, but it is critically important that you read the entire research study thoroughly from start to finish before you begin to write the executive summary. Take notes as you go along, highlighting important statements of fact, key findings, and recommended courses of action. This will better prepare you for how to organize and summarize the study. Remember this is not a brief abstract of 300 words or less but, essentially, a mini-paper of your paper, with a focus on recommendations. Isolate the Major Points Within the Original Document Choose which parts of the document are the most important to those who will read it. These points must be included within the executive summary in order to provide a thorough and complete explanation of what the document is trying to convey. Separate the Main Sections Closely examine each section of the original document and discern the main differences in each. After you have a firm understanding about what each section offers in respect to the other sections, write a few sentences for each section describing the main ideas. Although the format may vary, the main sections of an executive summary likely will include the following: An opening statement, with brief background information, The purpose of research study, Method of data gathering and analysis, Overview of findings, and, A description of each recommendation, accompanied by a justification. Note that the recommendations are sometimes quoted verbatim from the research study. Combine the Information Use the information gathered to combine them into an executive summary that is no longer than 10% of the original document. Be concise! The purpose is to provide a brief explanation of the entire document with a focus on the recommendations that have emerged from your research. How you word this will likely differ depending on your audience and what they care about most. If necessary, selectively incorporate bullet points for emphasis and brevity. Re-read your Executive Summary After you've completed your executive summary, let it sit for a while before coming back to re-read it. Check to make sure that the summary will make sense as a separate document from the full research study. By taking some time before re-reading it, you allow yourself to see the summary with fresh, unbiased eyes. Common Mistakes to Avoid Length of the Executive Summary As a general rule, the correct length of an executive summary is that it meets the criteria of no more pages than 10% of the number of pages in the original document, with an upper limit of no more than ten pages [i.e., ten pages for a 100 page document]. This requirement keeps the document short enough to be read by your audience, but long enough to allow it to be a complete, stand-alone synopsis. Cutting and Pasting With the exception of specific recommendations made in the study, do not simply cut and paste whole sections of the original document into the executive summary. You should paraphrase information from the longer document. Avoid taking up space with excessive subtitles and lists, unless they are absolutely necessary for the reader to have a complete understanding of the original document. Consider the Audience Although unlikely to be required by your professor, there is the possibility that more than one executive summary will have to be written for a given document [e.g., one for policy-makers, one for private industry, one for philanthropists]. This may only necessitate the rewriting of the introduction and conclusion, but it could require rewriting the entire summary in order to fit the needs of the reader. If necessary, be sure to consider the types of audiences who may benefit from your study and make adjustments accordingly. Clarity in Writing One of the biggest mistakes you can make is related to the clarity of your executive summary. Always note that your audience [or audiences] are likely seeing your research study for the first time. The best way to avoid a disorganized or cluttered executive summary is to write it after the study is completed. Always follow the same strategies for proofreading that you would for any research paper. Use Strong and Positive Language Don\u2019t weaken your executive summary with passive, imprecise language. The executive summary is a stand-alone document intended to convince the reader to make a decision concerning whether to implement the recommendations you make. Once convinced, it is assumed that the full document will provide the details needed to implement the recommendations. Although you should resist the temptation to pad your summary with pleas or biased statements, do pay particular attention to ensuring that a sense of urgency is created in the implications, recommendations, and conclusions presented in the executive summary. Be sure to target readers who are likely to implement the recommendations. Bailey, Edward, P. The Plain English Approach to Business Writing .

            "box_content": "It is often the case that a research problem, even one assigned by your professor, interests you because it relates to a current issue in the news or it reflects something you have very recently experienced. Choosing a research problem that connects to current affairs is an excellent way to remain engaged in the topic because it's happening now and a definitive outcome has yet to play itself out. However, you could experience a number of problems if your topic focuses on a very recent issue or event, including the following: It can be difficult to find scholarly sources and, as a consequence, your study may be considered less rigorous and valid because it does not cite research studies that provide in-depth analysis of the topic. Examination of a very recent event or issue may force you to draw upon historical precedents in order to frame the research problem effectively. As a consequence, though, the scholarly sources supporting your paper end up being more about the historical precedents than the current research problem. The consequences or results of a current event or issue have yet to be determined and, therefore, any conclusions or recommendations presented in your paper may be rendered less relevant as things unfold. A current issue or event is rarely a static unit of analysis; it is more like a moving target. Given this, it can be difficult to focus on a specific research problem related to the topic you've chosen to investigate because its relevance or importance may diminish over time due to unforeseen circumstances, while at the same time, new and significant topics may emerge instead.

            "box_content": "An indication that the timeliness of a research problem is too current would be if the only information you find are press releases from news service organizations like the Associated Press, articles from popular magazines and newspapers, online sources like blogs, and other non-scholarly sources . Depending on the assignment, relying on non-scholarly sources may be acceptable, but most often, professors require you to cite scholarly research studies to support your analysis. However, in the social sciences, research submitted for publication frequently takes more than a year between editorial review of a manuscript to when the study is finally published. In response to this, many journal publishers provide online access to what is termed \"pre-prints.\" These are essentially online versions of the final draft of a manuscript and, thus, should not be considered the authoritative copy of an article [unless it has been designated as the \"final copy\"]. Given these factors, it will often be difficult, or perhaps impossible, to locate scholarly research studies about a current issue or a newly emerging event. The obvious solution is to choose a different research problem to investigate. However, do not abandon your topic if it is of particular interest to you because there are several strategies you can use to find scholarly or research-level analysis. 1. Look for related literature that provides the opportunity to conduct a comparative analysis . For example, only now are scholarly studies emerging that investigate the impact and possible significance of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, by reviewing the research literature about past Russian incursions in Georgia and Syria, for example, you can extrapolate key lessons learned or identify new ways of understanding the central research problem associated with the current, emerging event. 2. Locate opinions/statements of prominent authors and scholars . Leading researchers are often called upon by mass media news organizations, editors of leading newspapers, and other print and online media outlets to comment and provide insight about an issue or during and immediately after an event. For example, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many prominent experts on disaster management and recovery were interviewed and asked to comment on how New Orleans should be rebuilt. Although these sources did not constitute a body of scholarly research because they were not peer-reviewed or may not have included references to sources, the writings of leading scholars can be considered authoritative because they represent the opinions and observations of experts who have gained in-depth knowledge of the topic as a result of conducting prior research. 3. Identify research centers and special interest organizations that focus on studying current issues and events . Research centers, special interest, and non-governmental organizations often lead the effort to study and publish in-depth reports about a current issue or event. In the case of research centers, this is because their purpose is to bring together scholars and practitioners who have interdisciplinary expertise in a particular area of study. Special interest groups are often proactive in studying current issues because their mission is to influence policy or to promote a specific social or economic agenda. Although often written by experts, it is important to note that some research institutes and special interest groups are privately funded and, therefore, you should pay particular attention to the possibility of bias in their analysis or recommendations. A good source for identifying research centers and special interest organizations is the Gale Directory Library database. 4.\u00a0 Look for Congressional Hearings and government agency reports . Congress often holds hearings shortly after an important or quickly evolving event [e.g., global pandemic recovery] or about a very new topic of public interest [e.g., January 6th Capitol attack]. Although politically-driven, testimonies before Congressional committees are often presented by leading scholars and experts in the field who provide detailed explanation and analysis of an issue. However, unlike the opinions of experts published in newspapers and other media outlets, the testimony of witnesses during Congressional hearings are legally valid because they are under oath. Published hearings often include additional documents submitted by members \"for the record\" that could be considered authoritative. In addition to Congress, many governmental agencies issue reports produced by experts in the field. To locate Congressional hearings GO HERE .

Given this, investigations\u00a0of current research problems often require\u00a0you to rely predominantly\u00a0on the\u00a0direct and uninterpreted analyses\u00a0of authoritative sources published in primary source materials . Studies of non-current research problems are generally published in scholarly secondary sources . However, because\u00a0there may be\u00a0little, if any, prior research of current issues or events, there is more freedom\u00a0to apply\u00a0abductive reasoning to\u00a0explain possible consequences, solutions, or outcomes.\u00a0This is not to say that can you ignore related research or delve into\u00a0idle speculation; your conclusions must be grounded in reality and available evidence, even if that evidence is not peer reviewed. However, the lens through which you interpret current research problems does not have to be designed so rigidly around prior research\u00a0because it simply may not exist.

As a separate section of a research paper, endnotes allow the reader to read and contemplate all the notes at once. Disadvantages of Using Endnotes If you want to look at the text of a particular endnote, you have to flip to the end of the research paper to find the information. Depending on how they are created [i.e., continuous numbering or numbers that start over for each chapter], you may have to remember the chapter number as well as the endnote number in order to find the correct one. Endnotes may carry a negative connotation much like the proverbial \"fine print\" or hidden disclaimers in advertising. A reader may believe you are trying to hide something by burying it in a hard-to-find endnote. Advantages of Using Footnotes Readers interested in identifying the source or note can quickly glance down the page to find what they are looking for. It allows the reader to immediately link the footnote to the subject of the text without having to take the time to find the note at the back of the paper. Footnotes are automatically included when printing off specific pages. Disadvantages of Using Footnotes Footnotes can clutter up the page and, thus, negatively impact the overall look of the page. If there are multiple columns, charts, or tables below only a small segment of text that includes a footnote, then you must decide where the footnotes should appear. If the footnotes are lengthy, there's a risk they could dominate the page, although this issue is considered acceptable in legal scholarship. Things to keep in mind when considering using either endnotes or footnotes in your research paper : 1. Footnotes are numbered consecutively throughout a research paper, except for those notes accompanying special material (e.g., figures, tables, charts, etc.). Numbering of footnotes are \"superscript\"--Arabic numbers typed slightly above the line of text. Do not include periods, parentheses, or slashes. They can follow all punctuation marks except dashes. In general, to avoid interrupting the continuity of the text, footnote numbers are placed at the end of the sentence, clause, or phrase containing the quoted or paraphrased material. 2. Depending on the writing style used in your class, endnotes may take the place of a list of resources cited in your paper or they may represent non-bibliographic items, such as comments or observations, followed by a separate list of references to the sources you cited and arranged alphabetically by the author's last name. If you are unsure about how to use endnotes, consult with your professor. 3. In general, the use of footnotes in most academic writing is now considered a bit outdated and has been replaced by endnotes, which are much easier to place in your paper, even with the advent of word processing programs. However, some disciplines, such as law and history, still predominantly utilize footnotes. Consult with your professor about which form to use and always remember that, whichever style of citation you choose, apply it consistently throughout your paper. NOTE: Always think critically about the information you place in a footnote or endnote. Ask yourself, is this supplementary or tangential information that would otherwise disrupt the narrative flow of the text or is this essential information that I should integrate into the main text? If you are not sure, it's better to work it into the text. Too many notes implies a disorganized paper. Cermak, Bonni and Jennifer Troxell.

            "box_content": "Depending on the writing style you are asked to use [e.g., APA, Chicago, MLA], a list of further readings should be located at the end of your paper after the endnotes or references but before any appendices. The list should begin under the heading \"Further Readings.\" Items can be arranged alphabetically by the author's last name, categorized under sub-headings by material type [e.g., books, articles, websites, etc.], or listed by the type of content [e.g., theory, methods, etc.]. If you choose to include a list of further readings, keep in mind the following: The references to further readings are not critical to understanding the central research problem . In other words, if further readings were not included, the citations to sources used in writing the paper would be sufficient enough for the reader to evaluate the credibility of your literature review and analysis of the existing research on the topic. Although further readings represent additional or suggested sources, they still must be viewed as relevant to the research problem . Don't include further readings simply to show off your skills in searching for materials on your topic. Even though they may not be central to understanding the research problem, every item listed must relate in some way to helping the reader locate additional information or obtain a broader understanding of the topic. Do not include basic survey texts or reference books like encyclopedias and dictionaries . Including these types of sources in a list of further readings implies reference to either very general or very specific information that likely should have been integrated into the text of your paper. In addition, these types of resources rarely add any significant understanding to the research problem. If you have identified non-textual materials related to your topic that may be of interest to the reader but were not used for your paper, consider including them in a list of further readings. This may include references to sources such as archival collections, documentary or popular films, photograph collections, audio files, or large data sets. To identify possible titles to include in a list of further readings , examine the sources you found while researching your paper but that you ended up not citing as a source. Review these items and, playing the role of reader, think about which ones may provide additional insight or background information about the research problem you have investigated. Soles, Derek.

            "box_title": "Glossary of Research Terms",
            "box_content": "This glossary is intended to assist you in understanding commonly used terms and concepts when reading, interpreting, and evaluating scholarly research in the social sciences. Also included are general words and phrases defined within the context of how they apply to research in the social and behavioral sciences. Acculturation -- refers to the process of adapting to another culture, particularly in reference to blending in with the majority population [e.g., an immigrant adopting American customs]. However, acculturation also implies that both cultures add something to one another, but still remain distinct groups unto themselves. Accuracy -- a term used in survey research to refer to the match between the target population and the sample. Affective Measures -- procedures or devices used to obtain quantified descriptions of an individual's feelings, emotional states, or dispositions. Aggregate -- a total created from smaller units. For instance, the population of a county is an aggregate of the populations of the cities, rural areas, etc. that comprise the county. As a verb, it refers to total data from smaller units into a large unit. Anonymity -- a research condition in which no one, including the researcher, knows the identities of research participants. Baseline -- a control measurement carried out before an experimental treatment. Behaviorism -- school of psychological thought concerned with the observable, tangible, objective facts of behavior, rather than with subjective phenomena such as thoughts, emotions, or impulses. Contemporary behaviorism also emphasizes the study of mental states such as feelings and fantasies to the extent that they can be directly observed and measured. Beliefs -- ideas, doctrines, tenets, etc. that are accepted as true on grounds which are not immediately susceptible to rigorous proof. Benchmarking -- systematically measuring and comparing the operations and outcomes of organizations, systems, processes, etc., against agreed upon \"best-in-class\" frames of reference. Bias -- a loss of balance and accuracy in the use of research methods. It can appear in research via the sampling frame, random sampling, or non-response. It can also occur at other stages in research, such as while interviewing, in the design of questions, or in the way data are analyzed and presented. Bias means that the research findings will not be representative of, or generalizable to, a wider population. Case Study -- the collection and presentation of detailed information about a particular participant or small group, frequently including data derived from the subjects themselves. Causal Hypothesis -- a statement hypothesizing that the independent variable affects the dependent variable in some way. Causal Relationship -- the relationship established that shows that an independent variable, and nothing else, causes a change in a dependent variable. It also establishes how much of a change is shown in the dependent variable. Causality -- the relation between cause and effect. Central Tendency -- any way of describing or characterizing typical, average, or common values in some distribution. Chi-square Analysis -- a common non-parametric statistical test which compares an expected proportion or ratio to an actual proportion or ratio. Claim -- a statement, similar to a hypothesis, which is made in response to the research question and that is affirmed with evidence based on research. Classification -- ordering of related phenomena into categories, groups, or systems according to characteristics or attributes. Cluster Analysis -- a method of statistical analysis where data that share a common trait are grouped together. The data is collected in a way that allows the data collector to group data according to certain characteristics. Cohort Analysis -- group by group analytic treatment of individuals having a statistical factor in common to each group. Group members share a particular characteristic [e.g., born in a given year] or a common experience [e.g., entering a college at a given time]. Confidentiality -- a research condition in which no one except the researcher(s) knows the identities of the participants in a study. It refers to the treatment of information that a participant has disclosed to the researcher in a relationship of trust and with the expectation that it will not be revealed to others in ways that violate the original consent agreement, unless permission is granted by the participant. Confirmability Objectivity -- the findings of the study could be confirmed by another person conducting the same study. Construct -- refers to any of the following: something that exists theoretically but is not directly observable; a concept developed [constructed] for describing relations among phenomena or for other research purposes; or, a theoretical definition in which concepts are defined in terms of other concepts. For example, intelligence cannot be directly observed or measured; it is a construct. Construct Validity -- seeks an agreement between a theoretical concept and a specific measuring device, such as observation. Constructivism -- the idea that reality is socially constructed. It is the view that reality cannot be understood outside of the way humans interact and that the idea that knowledge is constructed, not discovered. Constructivists believe that learning is more active and self-directed than either behaviorism or cognitive theory would postulate. Content Analysis -- the systematic, objective, and quantitative description of the manifest or latent content of print or nonprint communications. Context Sensitivity -- awareness by a qualitative researcher of factors such as values and beliefs that influence cultural behaviors. Control Group -- the group in an experimental design that receives either no treatment or a different treatment from the experimental group. This group can thus be compared to the experimental group. Controlled Experiment -- an experimental design with two or more randomly selected groups [an experimental group and control group] in which the researcher controls or introduces the independent variable and measures the dependent variable at least two times [pre- and post-test measurements]. Correlation -- a common statistical analysis, usually abbreviated as r, that measures the degree of relationship between pairs of interval variables in a sample. The range of correlation is from -1.00 to zero to +1.00. Also, a non-cause and effect relationship between two variables. Covariate -- a product of the correlation of two related variables times their standard deviations. Used in true experiments to measure the difference of treatment between them. Credibility -- a researcher's ability to demonstrate that the object of a study is accurately identified and described based on the way in which the study was conducted. Critical Theory -- an evaluative approach to social science research, associated with Germany's neo-Marxist \u201cFrankfurt School,\u201d that aims to criticize as well as analyze society, opposing the political orthodoxy of modern communism. Its goal is to promote human emancipatory forces and to expose ideas and systems that impede them. Data -- factual information [as measurements or statistics] used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. Data Mining -- the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information, often to discover patterns and/or systematic relationships among variables. Data Quality -- this is the degree to which the collected data [results of measurement or observation] meet the standards of quality to be considered valid [trustworthy] and\u00a0 reliable [dependable]. Deductive -- a form of reasoning in which conclusions are formulated about particulars from general or universal premises. Dependability -- being able to account for changes in the design of the study and the changing conditions surrounding what was studied. Dependent Variable -- a variable that varies due, at least in part, to the impact of the independent variable. In other words, its value \u201cdepends\u201d on the value of the independent variable. For example, in the variables \u201cgender\u201d and \u201cacademic major,\u201d academic major is the dependent variable, meaning that your major cannot determine whether you are male or female, but your gender might indirectly lead you to favor one major over another. Deviation -- the distance between the mean and a particular data point in a given distribution. Discourse Community -- a community of scholars and researchers in a given field who respond to and communicate to each other through published articles in the community's journals and presentations at conventions. All members of the discourse community adhere to certain conventions for the presentation of their theories and research. Discrete Variable -- a variable that is measured solely in whole units, such as, gender and number of siblings. Distribution -- the range of values of a particular variable. Effect Size -- the amount of change in a dependent variable that can be attributed to manipulations of the independent variable. A large effect size exists when the value of the dependent variable is strongly influenced by the independent variable. It is the mean difference on a variable between experimental and control groups divided by the standard deviation on that variable of the pooled groups or of the control group alone. Emancipatory Research -- research is conducted on and with people from marginalized groups or communities. It is led by a researcher or research team who is either an indigenous or external insider; is interpreted within intellectual frameworks of that group; and, is conducted largely for the purpose of empowering members of that community and improving services for them. It also engages members of the community as co-constructors or validators of knowledge. Empirical Research -- the process of developing systematized knowledge gained from observations that are formulated to support insights and generalizations about the phenomena being researched. Epistemology -- concerns knowledge construction; asks what constitutes knowledge and how knowledge is validated. Ethnography -- method to study groups and/or cultures over a period of time. The goal of this type of research is to comprehend the particular group/culture through immersion into the culture or group. Research is completed through various methods but, since the researcher is immersed within the group for an extended period of time, more detailed information is usually collected during the research. Expectancy Effect -- any unconscious or conscious cues that convey to the participant in a study how the researcher wants them to respond. Expecting someone to behave in a particular way has been shown to promote the expected behavior. Expectancy effects can be minimized by using standardized interactions with subjects, automated data-gathering methods, and double blind protocols. External Validity -- the extent to which the results of a study are generalizable or transferable. Factor Analysis -- a statistical test that explores relationships among data. The test explores which variables in a data set are most related to each other. In a carefully constructed survey, for example, factor analysis can yield information on patterns of responses, not simply data on a single response. Larger tendencies may then be interpreted, indicating behavior trends rather than simply responses to specific questions. Field Studies -- academic or other investigative studies undertaken in a natural setting, rather than in laboratories, classrooms, or other structured environments. Focus Groups -- small, roundtable discussion groups charged with examining specific topics or problems, including possible options or solutions. Focus groups usually consist of 4-12 participants, guided by moderators to keep the discussion flowing and to collect and report the results. Framework -- the structure and support that may be used as both the launching point and the on-going guidelines for investigating a research problem. Generalizability -- the extent to which research findings and conclusions conducted on a specific study to groups or situations can be applied to the population at large. Grey Literature -- research produced by organizations outside of commercial and academic publishing that publish materials, such as, working papers, research reports, and briefing papers. Grounded Theory -- practice of developing other theories that emerge from observing a group. Theories are grounded in the group's observable experiences, but researchers add their own insight into why those experiences exist. Group Behavior -- behaviors of a group as a whole, as well as the behavior of an individual as influenced by his or her membership in a group. Hypothesis -- a tentative explanation based on theory to predict a causal relationship between variables. Independent Variable -- the conditions of an experiment that are systematically manipulated by the researcher. A variable that is not impacted by the dependent variable, and that itself impacts the dependent variable. In the earlier example of \"gender\" and \"academic major,\" (see Dependent Variable) gender is the independent variable. Individualism -- a theory or policy having primary regard for the liberty, rights, or independent actions of individuals. Inductive -- a form of reasoning in which a generalized conclusion is formulated from particular instances. Inductive Analysis -- a form of analysis based on inductive reasoning; a researcher using inductive analysis starts with answers, but formulates questions throughout the research process. Insiderness -- a concept in qualitative research that refers to the degree to which a researcher has access to and an understanding of persons, places, or things within a group or community based on being a member of that group or community. Internal Consistency -- the extent to which all questions or items assess the same characteristic, skill, or quality. Internal Validity -- the rigor with which the study was conducted [e.g., the study's design, the care taken to conduct measurements, and decisions concerning what was and was not measured]. It is also the extent to which the designers of a study have taken into account alternative explanations for any causal relationships they explore. In studies that do not explore causal relationships, only the first of these definitions should be considered when assessing internal validity. Life History -- a record of an event/events in a respondent's life told [written down, but increasingly audio or video recorded] by the respondent from his/her own perspective in his/her own words. A life history is different from a \"research story\" in that it covers a longer time span, perhaps a complete life, or a significant period in a life. Margin of Error -- the permittable or acceptable deviation from the target or a specific value. The allowance for slight error or miscalculation or changing circumstances in a study. Measurement -- process of obtaining a numerical description of the extent to which persons, organizations, or things possess specified characteristics. Meta-Analysis -- an analysis combining the results of several studies that address a set of related hypotheses. Methodology -- a theory or analysis of how research does and should proceed. Methods -- systematic approaches to the conduct of an operation or process. It includes steps of procedure, application of techniques, systems of reasoning or analysis, and the modes of inquiry employed by a discipline. Mixed-Methods -- a research approach that uses two or more methods from both the quantitative and qualitative research categories. It is also referred to as blended methods, combined methods, or methodological triangulation. Modeling -- the creation of a physical or computer analogy to understand a particular phenomenon. Modeling helps in estimating the relative magnitude of various factors involved in a phenomenon. A successful model can be shown to account for unexpected behavior that has been observed, to predict certain behaviors, which can then be tested experimentally, and to demonstrate that a given theory cannot account for certain phenomenon. Models -- representations of objects, principles, processes, or ideas often used for imitation or emulation. Naturalistic Observation -- observation of behaviors and events in natural settings without experimental manipulation or other forms of interference. Norm -- the norm in statistics is the average or usual performance. For example, students usually complete their high school graduation requirements when they are 18 years old. Even though some students graduate when they are younger or older, the norm is that any given student will graduate when he or she is 18 years old. Null Hypothesis -- the proposition, to be tested statistically, that the experimental intervention has \"no effect,\" meaning that the treatment and control groups will not differ as a result of the intervention. Investigators usually hope that the data will demonstrate some effect from the intervention, thus allowing the investigator to reject the null hypothesis. Ontology -- a discipline of philosophy that explores the science of what is, the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes, and relations in every area of reality. Panel Study -- a longitudinal study in which a group of individuals is interviewed at intervals over a period of time. Participant -- individuals whose physiological and/or behavioral characteristics and responses are the object of study in a research project. Peer-Review -- the process in which the author of a book, article, or other type of publication submits his or her work to experts in the field for critical evaluation, usually prior to publication. This is standard procedure in publishing scholarly research. Phenomenology -- a qualitative research approach concerned with understanding certain group behaviors from that group's point of view. Philosophy -- critical examination of the grounds for fundamental beliefs and analysis of the basic concepts, doctrines, or practices that express such beliefs. Phonology -- the study of the ways in which speech sounds form systems and patterns in language. Policy -- governing principles that serve as guidelines or rules for decision making and action in a given area. Policy Analysis -- systematic study of the nature, rationale, cost, impact, effectiveness, implications, etc., of existing or alternative policies, using the theories and methodologies of relevant social science disciplines. Population -- the target group under investigation. The population is the entire set under consideration. Samples are drawn from populations. Position Papers -- statements of official or organizational viewpoints, often recommending a particular course of action or response to a situation. Positivism -- a doctrine in the philosophy of science, positivism argues that science can only deal with observable entities known directly to experience. The positivist aims to construct general laws, or theories, which express relationships between phenomena. Observation and experiment is used to show whether the phenomena fit the theory. Predictive Measurement -- use of tests, inventories, or other measures to determine or estimate future events, conditions, outcomes, or trends. Principal Investigator -- the scientist or scholar with primary responsibility for the design and conduct of a research project. Probability -- the chance that a phenomenon will occur randomly. As a statistical measure, it is shown as p [the \"p\" factor]. Questionnaire -- structured sets of questions on specified subjects that are used to gather information, attitudes, or opinions. Random Sampling -- a process used in research to draw a sample of a population strictly by chance, yielding no discernible pattern beyond chance. Random sampling can be accomplished by first numbering the population, then selecting the sample according to a table of random numbers or using a random-number computer generator. The sample is said to be random because there is no regular or discernible pattern or order. Random sample selection is used under the assumption that sufficiently large samples assigned randomly will exhibit a distribution comparable to that of the population from which the sample is drawn. The random assignment of participants increases the probability that differences observed between participant groups are the result of the experimental intervention. Reliability -- the degree to which a measure yields consistent results. If the measuring instrument [e.g., survey] is reliable, then administering it to similar groups would yield similar results. Reliability is a prerequisite for validity. An unreliable indicator cannot produce trustworthy results. Representative Sample -- sample in which the participants closely match the characteristics of the population, and thus, all segments of the population are represented in the sample. A representative sample allows results to be generalized from the sample to the population. Rigor -- degree to which research methods are scrupulously and meticulously carried out in order to recognize important influences occurring in an experimental study. Sample -- the population researched in a particular study. Usually, attempts are made to select a \"sample population\" that is considered representative of groups of people to whom results will be generalized or transferred. In studies that use inferential statistics to analyze results or which are designed to be generalizable, sample size is critical, generally the larger the number in the sample, the higher the likelihood of a representative distribution of the population. Sampling Error -- the degree to which the results from the sample deviate from those that would be obtained from the entire population, because of random error in the selection of respondent and the corresponding reduction in reliability. Saturation -- a situation in which data analysis begins to reveal repetition and redundancy and when new data tend to confirm existing findings rather than expand upon them. Semantics -- the relationship between symbols and meaning in a linguistic system. Also, the cuing system that connects what is written in the text to what is stored in the reader's prior knowledge. Social Theories -- theories about the structure, organization, and functioning of human societies. Sociolinguistics -- the study of language in society and, more specifically, the study of language varieties, their functions, and their speakers. Standard Deviation -- a measure of variation that indicates the typical distance between the scores of a distribution and the mean; it is determined by taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations in a given distribution. It can be used to indicate the proportion of data within certain ranges of scale values when the distribution conforms closely to the normal curve. Statistical Analysis -- application of statistical processes and theory to the compilation, presentation, discussion, and interpretation of numerical data. Statistical Bias -- characteristics of an experimental or sampling design, or the mathematical treatment of data, that systematically affects the results of a study so as to produce incorrect, unjustified, or inappropriate inferences or conclusions. Statistical Significance -- the probability that the difference between the outcomes of the control and experimental group are great enough that it is unlikely due solely to chance. The probability that the null hypothesis can be rejected at a predetermined significance level [0.05 or 0.01]. Statistical Tests -- researchers use statistical tests to make quantitative decisions about whether a study's data indicate a significant effect from the intervention and allow the researcher to reject the null hypothesis. That is, statistical tests show whether the differences between the outcomes of the control and experimental groups are great enough to be statistically significant. If differences are found to be statistically significant, it means that the probability [likelihood] that these differences occurred solely due to chance is relatively low. Most researchers agree that a significance value of .05 or less [i.e., there is a 95% probability that the differences are real] sufficiently determines significance. Subcultures -- ethnic, regional, economic, or social groups exhibiting characteristic patterns of behavior sufficient to distinguish them from the larger society to which they belong. Testing -- the act of gathering and processing information about individuals' ability, skill, understanding, or knowledge under controlled conditions. Theory -- a general explanation about a specific behavior or set of events that is based on known principles and serves to organize related events in a meaningful way. A theory is not as specific as a hypothesis. Treatment -- the stimulus given to a dependent variable. Trend Samples -- method of sampling different groups of people at different points in time from the same population. Triangulation -- a multi-method or pluralistic approach, using different methods in order to focus on the research topic from different viewpoints and to produce a multi-faceted set of data. Also used to check the validity of findings from any one method. Unit of Analysis -- the basic observable entity or phenomenon being analyzed by a study and for which data are collected in the form of variables. Validity -- the degree to which a study accurately reflects or assesses the specific concept that the researcher is attempting to measure. A method can be reliable, consistently measuring the same thing, but not valid. Variable -- any characteristic or trait that can vary from one person to another [race, gender, academic major] or for one person over time [age, political beliefs]. Weighted Scores -- scores in which the components are modified by different multipliers to reflect their relative importance. White Paper -- an authoritative report that often states the position or philosophy about a social, political, or other subject, or a general explanation of an architecture, framework, or product technology written by a group of researchers. A white paper seeks to contain unbiased information and analysis regarding a business or policy problem that the researchers may be facing.

            "box_content": "Don't feel bad if you are confused about what is the dependent variable and what is the independent variable in social and behavioral sciences research . However, it's important that you learn the difference because framing a study using these variables is a common approach to organizing the elements of a social sciences research study in order to discover relevant and meaningful results. Specifically, it is important for these two reasons: You need to understand and be able to evaluate their application in other people's research. You need to apply them correctly in your own research. A variable in research simply refers to a person, place, thing, or phenomenon that you are trying to measure in some way. The best way to understand the difference between a dependent and independent variable is that the meaning of each is implied by what the words tell us about the variable you are using. You can do this with a simple exercise from the website, Graphic Tutorial. Take the sentence, \"The [independent variable] causes a change in [dependent variable] and it is not possible that [dependent variable] could cause a change in [independent variable].\" Insert the names of variables you are using in the sentence in the way that makes the most sense. This will help you identify each type of variable. If you're still not sure, consult with your professor before you begin to write.

            "box_content": "The process of examining a research problem in the social and behavioral sciences is often framed around methods of analysis that compare, contrast, correlate, average, or integrate relationships between or among variables . Techniques include associations, sampling, random selection, and blind selection. Designation of the dependent and independent variable involves unpacking the research problem in a way that identifies a general cause and effect and classifying these variables as either independent or dependent. The variables should be outlined in the introduction of your paper and explained in more detail in the methods section . There are no rules about the structure and style for writing about independent or dependent variables but, as with any academic writing, clarity and being succinct is most important. After you have described the research problem and its significance in relation to prior research, explain why you have chosen to examine the problem using a method of analysis that investigates the relationships between or among independent and dependent variables . State what it is about the research problem that lends itself to this type of analysis. For example, if you are investigating the relationship between corporate environmental sustainability efforts [the independent variable] and dependent variables associated with measuring employee satisfaction at work using a survey instrument, you would first identify each variable and then provide background information about the variables. What is meant by \"environmental sustainability\"? Are you looking at a particular company [e.g., General Motors] or are you investigating an industry [e.g., the meat packing industry]? Why is employee satisfaction in the workplace important? How does a company make their employees aware of sustainability efforts and why would a company even care that its employees know about these efforts? Identify each variable for the reader and define each . In the introduction, this information can be presented in a paragraph or two when you describe how you are going to study the research problem. In the methods section, you build on the literature review of prior studies about the research problem to describe in detail background about each variable, breaking each down for measurement and analysis. For example, what activities do you examine that reflect a company's commitment to environmental sustainability? Levels of employee satisfaction can be measured by a survey that asks about things like volunteerism or a desire to stay at the company for a long time. The structure and writing style of describing the variables and their application to analyzing the research problem should be stated and unpacked in such a way that the reader obtains a clear understanding of the relationships between the variables and why they are important. This is also important so that the study can be replicated in the future using the same variables but applied in a different way.

            "box_content": "In the social and behavioral sciences, it is assumed that an insider researcher has greater access to information because they possess a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the setting in which they are conducting the research . For example, a teacher studying the impact of standardized testing on the mental well-being of minority students at the high school where they work should already have preceding knowledge about the school's student support culture, access to classrooms to observe students, access to statistical data, such as, grades and attendance records, and working relationships with school administrators, counselors, and parents who could be participants in the study. A researcher who is not an employee of the school would have to negotiate and maintain this level of access in order to conduct the research. If you are conducting insider research, you must describe how your position as an insider facilitated access to information, documents, places, objects, or any other elements of the setting relevant to addressing the research problem and, conversely, how you managed your insiderness in a way that avoided unintentional bias,\u00a0misuse of personal data, and potentially false conclusions based on unsubstantiated suppositions . With this in mind, here is a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of being an insider researcher, framed in the context of values versus assumptions. ADVANTAGES The Value of Shared Experiences -- as an insider, the researcher has experienced many of the same situations, events, issues, or problems as other members have within the research setting. This provides a common frame of reference between the insider researcher and other members of the research setting. Shared experiences also help establish a foundation from which to launch the study and build productive relationships with potential respondents. In this way, shared experiences helps build trust, which can facilitate obtaining information from other members within the setting that the researcher might otherwise have never been exposed to . The Value of Greater Access -- an insider would have greater access to people, places, data, and materials within the research setting. They would already having relationships with others in the setting; they would understand the physical layout of the setting; they would be aware of places where, for example, people interact or gather; and, they would be familiar with the how and by what means information in the form of documents, email, statistics, and other types of data are produced, distributed, and shared within the setting. The Value of Cultural Inter pretation -- an insider would be familiar with the beliefs, values, rules, material traits, and customs that define the unique culture of the research setting. This level of interpretive access provides insights into the unique ways of thinking, behaving, working, or other forms of behavioral interaction that exists among people within a group, organization, or community. An insider would also be familiar with specific sub-cultures within the setting and how they relate to each other. The Value of Deeper Understanding and Clarity of Thought -- related to cultural familiarity, an insider researcher would be better able to interpret, critique, and draw appropriate inferences or conclusions about what is observed or learned in a way that an external researcher would have to learn from respondents or from analyzing secondary sources to help verify the accuracy of information. An insider would already understand and draw meaning from the contexts by which phenomena occur relevant to the research problem being investigated. DISADVANTAGES The Assumption of Absolute Access -- insiderness is not unequivocal or without limit. Any level of access exists within a given moment and contextualized around the level of access available to others. Access varies because the circumstances in relation to the gathering of information is different each time you enter the setting, who you interact with, what you observe, and when. Access also varies in relation to the people you rely upon for information. Everyone within the setting will possess varying degrees of their own access to information that is relayed to you.\u00a0 Always be cognizant of the fact that, just because you have insider access, it does not mean you already possess a comprehensive understanding of the research setting. The Assumption of No Effect on Others -- the transition of your position from member of a group, organization, or community to a member/researcher can influence people's perceptions of you and, by extension, their relationship to you acting as a researcher. Given this, you may need to place greater emphasis on building trust within the setting than an external researcher would need to. An external researcher does not possess prior knowledge or have prior interactions with others in the setting, therefore, they may be viewed as being more impartial and behaving as a neutral entity while conducting their research. The Assumption of Unbiased Perspectives -- as an insider, you must guard against making predetermined judgements about the information you have gathered or any aspect of the research setting because you already \"know\" the group, organization, or community . The nature of being an insider requires controlling for any unintentional bias by applying on-going reflexivity to the interpretation of your analysis of information. This means deliberately and critically turning ideas and concepts back onto yourself in order to reveal and clarify your own beliefs about the information you have gathered. NOTE: A potential form of biased behavior in insider research is confirmation bias. This refers to an unconscious tendency to search for or interpret information that is consistent with or validates your existing beliefs, ideas, or hypotheses about the research problem. This type of bias is based on the idea that people have a predilection to more readily accept information that supports their existing worldview while, at the same time, being suspicious of information that challenges that worldview. As an insider, you must be critically aware throughout your study of any potential assumptions made about the group, organization, or community that, upon reflection, appears to only confirm existing beliefs about the research setting.

            "box_content": "Insiderness is an approach to conducting research in which the researcher is positioned within the setting where they are gathering and analyzing information. The insider researcher is a member of the group, organization, or community where they are conducting the study and, as such, may be assumed to have greater access to information, respondents, and data than a researcher who is external to the research setting. Although the concept of insiderness is applied primarily to qualitative methods of observation, interviewing, ethnography, and other normative techniques of gathering information, an insider researcher can also be positioned to gather quantitative forms of data.

            "box_content": "In general, the amount of details describing your status as an insider depends on three factors: How deeply embedded your position was in the research setting and, as a result, the level of access you had to information relevant to examining the research problem, The amount of time you were involved in researching the setting, not just in totality, but variance of time spent in different spaces of the setting, and The complexity of the setting, which can include factors, such as, the spatial distribution of people, the number of sub-cultures within the setting, the types of information needed for the study, the size of the group, organization, or community, and the level of interconnectedness and interdependency among various elements of the setting. These details should be well documented so that the reader has a complete picture of how your insiderness facilitated effective information gathering techniques. However, focus on only those elements of complexity that relate to studying the research problem. For example, if you spent time observing teachers in the classroom, there is no need to describe their interaction with objects in the setting [e.g., technology] unless the research is designed to include this in the study. Regardless of your level of embeddedness or the complexity of the setting, you should describe the following aspects of being an insider researcher in the methodology section of your paper. These are in the general order in which they should be described in the methods section of your paper. Describe the reasons you designed the study in this way . In short, answer the \"So What?\" question. Frame the reasons for choosing to study the setting as an insider by describing why did you choose this approach rather than another setting in which you would not an insider. Explain the circumstances under which you chose to reveal yourself as a researcher or remained silent and describe what advantages or disadvantages your choice had in terms of access and understanding the research problem. Explain the process of how you presented yourself transitioning from being a member of the group, organization, or community to being a researcher of that entity . Describe how you negotiated this and note if any limits were placed on you in terms of access to people, places, material items, or sources of quantitative data. Explain the ways in which your insiderness was advantageous in gathering the information needed to address the research problem. If applicable, document any information, materials, or data you were able to access that would otherwise be unavailable or hidden to an outside researcher and how this enhanced your ability to examine the research problem. Highlight any limitations you encountered in terms of access , particularly as it relates to your position within the research setting. For example, if you are conducting research as a student intern in an organization, explain why you did not have the same access to historical data as a long-term employee would have. Conclude your description of being an insider researcher by describing how you controlled for unintentional bias using methods of self-reflexivity, such as, keeping a journal of personal thoughts and observations during the research process or critically questioning your voice in the text as you write the paper . This part of your methodology section should also describe any ethical dilemmas you encountered while being an insider researcher. NOTE : Convenience is not a valid reason for conducting insider research! You must justify your choice to be an insider researcher in a way that reflects issues of not only access, but in terms of obtaining greater insight and understanding of the research problem. You must explain why your degree of closeness to the group, organization, or community specifically addresses the research problem that could be attained by an external researcher. Convenience is never the justification for why a research problem should be investigated in the social and behavioral sciences regardless of the method chosen. ANOTHER NOTE : Insiderness is not just a methodological approach to doing research but defines your position as an author within the entire investigative and interpretive process of the study. While the details about your insiderness should be described primarily in the methodology section of your paper, you must first present yourself as an insider researcher in the introduction. The literature review should highlight any other insider research studies or, if none exist, provide documentary evidence as to why an insider approach is crucial to building new knowledge about the research problem. In the discussion section, you should also note how your position as an insider helped [and perhaps, in some cases, hindered] your interpretation of the findings.

If you didn't get the results you anticipated, it may mean your hypothesis was incorrect and needs to be reformulated. Or, perhaps you have stumbled onto something unexpected that warrants further study. Moreover, the absence of an effect may be very telling in many situations, particularly in experimental research designs. In any case, your results may very well be of importance to others even though they did not support your hypothesis. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that results contrary to what you expected is a limitation to your study.

            "box_title": "Descriptions of Possible Limitations",
            "box_content": "All studies have limitations . However, it is important that you restrict your discussion to limitations related to the research problem under investigation. For example, if a meta-analysis of existing literature is not a stated purpose of your research, it should not be discussed as a limitation. Do not apologize for not addressing issues that you did not promise to investigate in the introduction of your paper. Here are examples of limitations related to methodology and the research process you may need to describe and discuss how they possibly impacted your results. Note that descriptions of limitations should be stated in the past tense because they were discovered after you completed your research. Possible Methodological Limitations Sample size -- the number of the units of analysis you use in your study is dictated by the type of research problem you are investigating. Note that, if your sample size is too small, it will be difficult to find significant relationships from the data, as statistical tests normally require a larger sample size to ensure a representative distribution of the population and to be considered representative of groups of people to whom results will be generalized or transferred. Note that sample size is generally less relevant in qualitative research if explained in the context of the research problem. Lack of available and/or reliable data -- a lack of data or of reliable data will likely require you to limit the scope of your analysis, the size of your sample, or it can be a significant obstacle in finding a trend and a meaningful relationship. You need to not only describe these limitations but provide cogent reasons why you believe data is missing or is unreliable. However, don\u2019t just throw up your hands in frustration; use this as an opportunity to describe a need for future research based on designing a different method for gathering data. Lack of prior research studies on the topic -- citing prior research studies forms the basis of your literature review and helps lay a foundation for understanding the research problem you are investigating. Depending on the currency or scope of your research topic, there may be little, if any, prior research on your topic. Before assuming this to be true, though, consult with a librarian! In cases when a librarian has confirmed that there is little or no prior research, you may be required to develop an entirely new research typology [for example, using an exploratory rather than an explanatory research design ]. Note again that discovering a limitation can serve as an important opportunity to identify new gaps in the literature and to describe the need for further research. Measure used to collect the data -- sometimes it is the case that, after completing your interpretation of the findings, you discover that the way in which you gathered data inhibited your ability to conduct a thorough analysis of the results. For example, you regret not including a specific question in a survey that, in retrospect, could have helped address a particular issue that emerged later in the study. Acknowledge the deficiency by stating a need for future researchers to revise the specific method for gathering data. Self-reported data -- whether you are relying on pre-existing data or you are conducting a qualitative research study and gathering the data yourself, self-reported data is limited by the fact that it rarely can be independently verified. In other words, you have to the accuracy of what people say, whether in interviews, focus groups, or on questionnaires, at face value. However, self-reported data can contain several potential sources of bias that you should be alert to and note as limitations. These biases become apparent if they are incongruent with data from other sources. These are: (1) selective memory [remembering or not remembering experiences or events that occurred at some point in the past]; (2) telescoping [recalling events that occurred at one time as if they occurred at another time]; (3) attribution [the act of attributing positive events and outcomes to one's own agency, but attributing negative events and outcomes to external forces]; and, (4) exaggeration [the act of representing outcomes or embellishing events as more significant than is actually suggested from other data]. Possible Limitations of the Researcher Access -- if your study depends on having access to people, organizations, data, or documents and, for whatever reason, access is denied or limited in some way, the reasons for this needs to be described. Also, include an explanation why being denied or limited access did not prevent you from following through on your study. Longitudinal effects -- unlike your professor, who can literally devote years [even a lifetime] to studying a single topic, the time available to investigate a research problem and to measure change or stability over time is constrained by the due date of your assignment. Be sure to choose a research problem that does not require an excessive amount of time to complete the literature review, apply the methodology, and gather and interpret the results. If you're unsure whether you can complete your research within the confines of the assignment's due date, talk to your professor. Cultural and other type of bias -- we all have biases, whether we are conscience of them or not. Bias is when a person, place, event, or thing is viewed or shown in a consistently inaccurate way. Bias is usually negative, though one can have a positive bias as well, especially if that bias reflects your reliance on research that only support your hypothesis. When proof-reading your paper, be especially critical in reviewing how you have stated a problem, selected the data to be studied, what may have been omitted, the manner in which you have ordered events, people, or places, how you have chosen to represent a person, place, or thing, to name a phenomenon, or to use possible words with a positive or negative connotation. NOTE: If you detect bias in prior research, it must be acknowledged and you should explain what measures were taken to avoid perpetuating that bias. For example, if a previous study only used boys to examine how music education supports effective math skills, describe how your research expands the study to include girls. Fluency in a language -- if your research focuses , for example, on measuring the perceived value of after-school tutoring among Mexican-American ESL [English as a Second Language] students and you are not fluent in Spanish, you are limited in being able to read and interpret Spanish language research studies on the topic or to speak with these students in their primary language. This deficiency should be acknowledged. Aguinis, Hermam and Jeffrey R.

It is far better that you identify and acknowledge your study\u2019s limitations than to have them pointed out by your professor and have your grade lowered because you appeared to have ignored them. Keep in mind that acknowledgment of a study's limitations is an opportunity to make suggestions for further research. If you do connect your study's limitations to suggestions for further research, be sure to explain the ways in which these unanswered questions may become more focused because of your study. Acknowledgment of a study's limitations also provides you with opportunities to demonstrate that you have thought critically about the research problem, understood the relevant literature published about it, and correctly assessed the methods chosen for studying the problem. A key objective of the research process is not only discovering new knowledge but also to confront assumptions and explore what we don't know. Claiming limitations is a subjective process because you must evaluate the impact of those limitations . Don't just list key weaknesses and the magnitude of a study's limitations. To do so diminishes the validity of your research because it leaves the reader wondering whether, or in what ways, limitation(s) in your study may have impacted the results and conclusions. Limitations require a critical, overall appraisal and interpretation of their impact.

Statements about a study's limitations should not be buried in the body [middle] of the discussion section unless a limitation is specific to something covered in that part of the paper. If this is the case, though, the limitation should be reiterated at the conclusion of the section.

Be sure, though, to specifically explain the ways that these flaws can be successfully overcome in a new study. But, do not use this as an excuse for not developing a thorough research paper! Review the tab in this guide for developing a research topic . If serious limitations exist, it generally indicates a likelihood that your research problem is too narrowly defined or that the issue or event under study is too recent and, thus, very little research has been written about it. If serious limitations do emerge, consult with your professor about possible ways to overcome them or how to revise your study. When discussing the limitations of your research, be sure to: Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms; Explain why each limitation exists; Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire or gather the data [cite to other studies that had similar problems when possible]; Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your study; and, If appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research. Remember that the method you chose may be the source of a significant limitation that has emerged during your interpretation of the results [for example, you didn't interview a group of people that you later wish you had]. If this is the case, don't panic. Acknowledge it, and explain how applying a different or more robust methodology might address the research problem more effectively in a future study.

            "box_content": "Sample Size Limitations in Qualitative Research Sample sizes are typically smaller in qualitative research because, as the study goes on, acquiring more data does not necessarily lead to more information. This is because one occurrence of a piece of data, or a code, is all that is necessary to ensure that it becomes part of the analysis framework. However, it remains true that sample sizes that are too small cannot adequately support claims of having achieved valid conclusions and sample sizes that are too large do not permit the deep, naturalistic, and inductive analysis that defines qualitative inquiry. Determining adequate sample size in qualitative research is ultimately a matter of judgment and experience in evaluating the quality of the information collected against the uses to which it will be applied and the particular research method and purposeful sampling strategy employed. If the sample size is found to be a limitation, it may reflect your judgment about the methodological technique chosen [e.g., single life history study versus focus group interviews] rather than the number of respondents used.

            "box_content": "Writing papers in college requires you to come up with sophisticated, complex, and sometimes very creative ways of structuring your ideas . Taking the time to draft an outline can help you determine if your ideas connect to each other, what order of ideas works best, where gaps in your thinking may exist, or whether you have sufficient evidence to support each of your points. It is also an effective way to think about the time you will need to complete each part of your paper before you begin writing. A good outline is important because : You will be much less likely to get writer's block . An outline will show where you're going and how to get there. Use the outline to set goals for completing each section of your paper. It will help you stay organized and focused throughout the writing process and help ensure proper coherence [flow of ideas] in your final paper. However, the outline should be viewed as a guide, not a straitjacket. As you review the literature or gather data, the organization of your paper may change; adjust your outline accordingly. A clear, detailed outline ensures that you always have something to help re-calibrate your writing should you feel yourself drifting into subject areas unrelated to the research problem. Use your outline to set boundaries around what you will investigate. The outline can be key to staying motivated . You can put together an outline when you're excited about the project and everything is clicking; making an outline is never as overwhelming as sitting down and beginning to write a twenty page paper without any sense of where it is going. An outline helps you organize multiple ideas about a topic . Most research problems can be analyzed from a variety of perspectives; an outline can help you sort out which modes of analysis are most appropriate to ensure the most robust findings are discovered. An outline not only helps you organize your thoughts, but it can also serve as a schedule for when certain aspects of your writing should be accomplished . Review the assignment and highlight the due dates of specific tasks and integrate these into your outline. If your professor has not created specific deadlines, create your own deadlines by thinking about your own writing style and the need to manage your time around other course assignments.

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0\u00a0 General Approaches There are two general approaches you can take when writing an outline for your paper: The topic outline consists of short phrases. This approach is useful when you are dealing with a number of different issues that could be arranged in a variety of different ways in your paper. Due to short phrases having more content than using simple sentences, they create better content from which to build your paper. The sentence outline is done in full sentences. This approach is useful when your paper focuses on complex issues in detail. The sentence outline is also useful because sentences themselves have many of the details in them needed to build a paper and it allows you to include those details in the sentences instead of having to create an outline of short phrases that goes on page after page. II.\u00a0\u00a0 Steps to Making the Outline A strong outline details each topic and subtopic in your paper, organizing these points so that they build your argument toward an evidence-based conclusion. Writing an outline will also help you focus on the task at hand and avoid unnecessary tangents, logical fallacies, and underdeveloped paragraphs. Identify the research problem . The research problem is the focal point from which the rest of the outline flows. Try to sum up the point of your paper in one sentence or phrase. It also can be key to deciding what the title of your paper should be. Identify the main categories . What main points will you analyze? The introduction describes all of your main points; the rest of\u00a0 your paper can be spent developing those points. Create the first category . What is the first point you want to cover? If the paper centers around a complicated term, a definition can be a good place to start. For a paper that concerns the application and testing of a particular theory, giving the general background on the theory can be a good place to begin. Create subcategories . After you have followed these steps, create points under it that provide support for the main point. The number of categories that you use depends on the amount of information that you are trying to cover. There is no right or wrong number to use. Once you have developed the basic outline of the paper, organize the contents to match the standard format of a research paper as described in this guide. III. \u00a0 Things to Consider When Writing an Outline There is no rule dictating which approach is best . Choose either a topic outline or a sentence outline based on which one you believe will work best for you. However, once you begin developing an outline, it's helpful to stick to only one approach. Both topic and sentence outlines use Roman and Arabic numerals along with capital and small letters of the alphabet arranged in a consistent and rigid sequence. A rigid format should be used especially if you are required to hand in your outline. Although the format of an outline is rigid, it shouldn't make you inflexible about how to write your paper. Often when you start investigating a research problem [i.e., reviewing the research literature], especially if you are unfamiliar with the topic, you should anticipate the likelihood your analysis could go in different directions. If your paper changes focus, or you need to add new sections, then feel free to reorganize the outline. If appropriate, organize the main points of your outline in chronological order . In papers where you need to trace the history or chronology of events or issues, it is important to arrange your outline in the same manner, knowing that it's easier to re-arrange things now than when you've almost finished your paper. For a standard research paper of 15-20 pages, your outline should be no more than few pages in length . It may be helpful as you are developing your outline to also write down a tentative list of references.

If, in writing your paper, it begins to diverge from your outline, this is very likely a sign that you've lost your focus. How do you know whether to change the paper to fit the outline, or, that you need to reconsider the outline so that it fits the paper? A good way to check your progress is to use what you have written to recreate the outline. This is an effective strategy for assessing the organization of your paper. If the resulting outline says what you want it to say and it is in an order that is easy to follow, then the organization of your paper has been successful. If you discover that it's difficult to create an outline from what you have written, then you likely need to revise your paper. Why and How to Create a Useful Outline. The Writing Lab and The OWL.

You could experience a number of problems if your topic is too broad, including: You find too many information sources and, as a consequence, it is difficult to decide what to include or exclude or what are the most important sources. You find information that is too general and, as a consequence, it is difficult to develop a clear framework for examining the research problem. A lack of sufficient parameters that clearly define the research problem makes it difficult to identify and apply the proper methods needed to analyze it. You find information that covers a wide variety of concepts or ideas that can't be integrated into one paper and, as a consequence, you trail off into unnecessary tangents.

            "box_title": "Strategies for Narrowing the Research Topic",
            "box_content": "A common challenge when beginning to write a research paper is determining how to narrow down your topic . Even if your professor gives you a specific topic to study, it will almost never be so specific that you won\u2019t have to narrow it down at least to some degree [besides, it is very boring to grade fifty papers that are all about the exact same thing!]. A topic is too broad to be manageable when a review of the literature reveals too many different, and oftentimes conflicting or only remotely related, ideas about how to investigate the research problem. Although you will want to start the writing process by considering a variety of different approaches to studying the research problem, you will need to narrow the focus of your investigation at some point early in the writing process. This way, you don't attempt to do too much in one paper. Here are some strategies to help narrow your topic : Aspect -- choose one lens through which to view the research problem, or look at just one facet of it [e.g., rather than studying the role of food in South Asian religious rituals, study the role of food in Hindu ceremonies, or, the role of one particular type of food among several religions]. Components -- determine if your initial variable or unit of analysis can be broken into smaller parts, which can then be analyzed more precisely [e.g., a study of tobacco use among adolescents can focus on just chewing tobacco rather than all forms of usage or, rather than adolescents in general, focus on female adolescents in a certain age range who choose to use tobacco]. Methodology -- the way in which you gather information can reduce the domain of interpretive analysis needed to address the research problem [e.g., a single case study can be designed to generate data that does not require as extensive an explanation as using multiple cases]. Place -- generally, the smaller the geographic unit of analysis, the more narrow the focus [e.g., rather than study trade relations in West Africa, study trade relations between Niger and Cameroon as a case study that helps to explain economic problems in the region]. Relationship -- ask yourself how do two or more different perspectives or variables relate to one another. Designing a study around the relationships between specific variables can help constrict the scope of analysis [e.g., cause/effect, compare/contrast, contemporary/historical, group/individual, child/adult, opinion/reason, problem/solution]. Time -- the shorter the time period of the study, the more narrow the focus [e.g., study of trade relations between Niger and Cameroon during the period of 2010 - 2020]. Type -- focus your topic in terms of a specific type or class of people, places, or phenomena [e.g., a study of developing safer traffic patterns near schools can focus on SUVs, or just student drivers, or just the timing of traffic signals in the area]. Combination -- use two or more of the above strategies to focus your topic more narrowly. NOTE : Apply one of the above strategies first in designing your study to determine if that gives you a manageable research problem to investigate. You will know if the problem is manageable by reviewing the literature on this more specific problem and assessing whether prior research on the narrower topic is sufficient to move forward in your study [i.e., not too much, not too little]. Be careful, however, because combining multiple strategies risks creating the opposite problem--your problem becomes too narrowly defined and you can't locate enough research or data to support your study.

            "box_content": "Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers . Without well-written paragraphs that flow logically from one idea to the next and that inform and help support in some meaningful way the central research problem being investigated, your paper will not be viewed as credible and, well, you'll probably receive a poor grade. Here are some suggestions for troubleshooting common problems associated with developing paragraphs: 1. The paragraph has no controlling idea . Imagine each paragraph as having three general layers of text. The core content is in the middle. It includes all the evidence you need to make the point. However, this evidence needs to be introduced by a topic sentence in some way or your readers don't know what to do with all the evidence you have given them. Therefore, the beginning of the paragraph explains the controlling idea of the paragraph. The last part of the paragraph tells the reader how the paragraph relates to the broader argument and often provides a transition to the next idea. Once you have mastered the use of topic sentences, you may decide that the topic sentence for a particular paragraph really should not be the first sentence of the paragraph. This is fine\u2014the topic sentence can actually go at the beginning, middle, or end of a paragraph; what's important is that it is there to inform readers what the main idea of the paragraph is and how it relates back to the broader thesis of your paper. 2. The paragraph has more than one controlling idea . This is the most common reason why a paragraph is too long. If a paragraph is more than a page long, it likely contains more than one controlling idea. In this case, consider eliminating sentences that relate to the second idea, with the thought that maybe they don't really inform and help support the central research problem, or split the paragraph into two or more paragraphs, each with only one controlling idea. 3. Transitions are needed within the paragraph . You are probably familiar with the idea that transitions may be needed between paragraphs or sections in a paper. Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single paragraph. Within a paragraph, transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish relationships between ideas and to create a logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph. This is especially true within paragraphs that discuss multiple examples or discuss complex ideas, issues, or concepts. Arnaudet, Martin L. and Mary Ellen Barrett.

            "box_content": "I. \u00a0General Structure Most paragraphs in an essay parallel the general three-part structure of each section of a research paper and, by extension, the overall research paper, with an introduction, a body that includes facts and analysis, and a conclusion. You can see this structure in paragraphs whether they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing information. Each part of the paragraph plays an important role in communicating the meaning you intend to covey to the reader. Introduction : the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence and any other sentences at the beginning of the paragraph that give background information or provide a transition. Body : follows the introduction; discusses the controlling idea, using facts, arguments, analysis, examples, and other information. Conclusion : the final section; summarizes the connections between the information discussed in the body of the paragraph and the paragraph\u2019s controlling idea. For long paragraphs, you may also want to include a bridge sentence that introduces the next paragraph or section of the paper. In some instances, the bridge sentence can be written in the form of a question. However, use this rhetorical device sparingly, otherwise, ending a lot of paragraphs with a question to lead into the next paragraph sounds cumbersome. NOTE: This general structure does not imply that you should not be creative in your writing. Arranging where each element goes in a paragraph can make a paper more engaging for the reader. However, do not be too creative in experimenting with the narrative flow of paragraphs. To do so may distract from the main arguments of your research and weaken the quality of your academic writing. II.\u00a0 Development and Organization Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must consider what is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader. This is the \"controlling idea,\" or the thesis statement from which you compose the remainder of the paragraph. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your controlling idea and the information in each paragraph. The research problem functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process of paragraph development is an organic one\u2014a natural progression from a seed idea to a full-blown research study where there are direct, familial relationships in the paper between all of\u00a0 your controlling ideas and the paragraphs which derive from them. The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with brainstorming about how you want to pursue the research problem . There are many techniques for brainstorming but, whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped because it lays a foundation for developing a set of paragraphs [representing a section of your paper] that describes a specific element of your overall analysis. Each section is described further in this writing guide. Given these factors, every paragraph in a paper should be : Unified \u2014All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea [often expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph]. Clearly related to the research problem \u2014The sentences should all refer to the central idea, or the thesis, of the paper. Coherent \u2014The sentences should be arranged in a logical manner and should follow a definite plan for development. Well-developed \u2014Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and supported through evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph's controlling idea. There are many different ways you can organize a paragraph . However, the organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. Ways to organize a paragraph in academic writing include: Narrative : Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. Descriptive : Provide specific details about what something looks or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. Process : Explain step by step how something works. Perhaps follow a sequence\u2014first, second, third. Classification : Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. Illustrative : Give examples and explain how those examples prove your point. Arnaudet, Martin L. and Mary Ellen Barrett. Paragraph Development: A Guide for Students of English . 2nd edition.

            "box_content": "Unlike positivist or experimental research that utilizes a linear and one-directional sequence of design steps, there is considerable variation in how a qualitative research study is organized. In general, qualitative researchers attempt to describe and interpret human behavior based primarily on the words of selected individuals [a.k.a., \u201cinformants\u201d or \u201crespondents\u201d] and/or through the interpretation of their material culture or occupied space. There is a reflexive process underpinning every stage of a qualitative study to ensure that researcher biases, presuppositions, and interpretations are clearly evident, thus ensuring that the reader is better able to interpret the overall validity of the research. According to Maxwell (2009), there are five, not necessarily ordered or sequential, components in qualitative research designs. How they are presented depends upon the research philosophy and theoretical framework of the study, the methods chosen, and the general assumptions underpinning the study. Goals Describe the central research problem being addressed but avoid describing any anticipated outcomes. Questions to ask yourself are: Why is your study worth doing? What issues do you want to clarify, and what practices and policies do you want it to influence? Why do you want to conduct this study, and why should the reader care about the results? Conceptual Framework Questions to ask yourself are: What do you think is going on with the issues, settings, or people you plan to study? What theories, beliefs, and prior research findings will guide or inform your research, and what literature, preliminary studies, and personal experiences will you draw upon for understanding the people or issues you are studying? Note to not only report the results of other studies in your review of the literature, but note the methods used as well. If appropriate, describe why earlier studies using quantitative methods were inadequate in addressing the research problem. Research Questions Usually there is a research problem that frames your qualitative study and that influences your decision about what methods to use, but qualitative designs generally lack an accompanying hypothesis or set of assumptions because the findings are emergent and unpredictable. In this context, more specific research questions are generally the result of an interactive design process rather than the starting point for that process. Questions to ask yourself are: What do you specifically want to learn or understand by conducting this study? What do you not know about the things you are studying that you want to learn? What questions will your research attempt to answer, and how are these questions related to one another? Methods Structured approaches to applying a method or methods to your study help to ensure that there is comparability of data across sources and researchers and, thus, they can be useful in answering questions that deal with differences between phenomena and the explanation for these differences [variance questions]. An unstructured approach allows the researcher to focus on the particular phenomena studied. This facilitates an understanding of the processes that led to specific outcomes, trading generalizability and comparability for internal validity and contextual and evaluative understanding. Questions to ask yourself are: What will you actually do in conducting this study? What approaches and techniques will you use to collect and analyze your data, and how do these constitute an integrated strategy? Validity In contrast to quantitative studies where the goal is to design, in advance, \u201ccontrols\u201d such as formal comparisons, sampling strategies, or statistical manipulations to address anticipated and unanticipated threats to validity, qualitative researchers must attempt to rule out most threats to validity after the research has begun by relying on evidence collected during the research process itself in order to effectively argue that any alternative explanations for a phenomenon are implausible. Questions to ask yourself are: How might your results and conclusions be wrong? What are the plausible alternative interpretations and validity threats to these, and how will you deal with these? How can the data that you have, or that you could potentially collect, support or challenge your ideas about what\u2019s going on? Why should we believe your results? Conclusion Although Maxwell does not mention a conclusion as one of the components of a qualitative research design, you should formally conclude your study. Briefly reiterate the goals of your study and the ways in which your research addressed them. Discuss the benefits of your study and how stakeholders can use your results. Also, note the limitations of your study and, if appropriate, place them in the context of areas in need of further research. Chenail, Ronald J. Introduction to Qualitative Research Design.

            "box_content": "Below are the three key elements that define a qualitative research study and the applied forms each take in the investigation of a research problem. The Design Naturalistic -- refers to studying real-world situations as they unfold naturally; non-manipulative and non-controlling; the researcher is open to whatever emerges [i.e., there is a lack of predetermined constraints on findings]. Emergent -- acceptance of adapting inquiry as understanding deepens and/or situations change; the researcher avoids rigid designs that eliminate responding to opportunities to pursue new paths of discovery as they emerge. Purposeful -- cases for study [e.g., people, organizations, communities, cultures, events, critical incidences] are selected because they are \u201cinformation rich\u201d and illuminative. That is, they offer useful manifestations of the phenomenon of interest; sampling is aimed at insight about the phenomenon, not empirical generalization derived from a sample and applied to a population. The Collection of Data Data -- observations yield a detailed, \"thick description\" [in-depth understanding]; interviews capture direct quotations about people\u2019s personal perspectives and lived experiences; often derived from carefully conducted case studies and review of material culture. Personal experience and engagement -- researcher has direct contact with and gets close to the people, situation, and phenomenon under investigation; the researcher\u2019s personal experiences and insights are an important part of the inquiry and critical to understanding the phenomenon. Empathic neutrality -- an empathic stance in working with study respondents seeks vicarious understanding without judgment [neutrality] by showing openness, sensitivity, respect, awareness, and responsiveness; in observation, it means being fully present [mindfulness]. Dynamic systems -- there is attention to process; assumes change is ongoing, whether the focus is on an individual, an organization, a community, or an entire culture, therefore, the researcher is mindful of and attentive to system and situational dynamics. The Analysis Unique case orientation -- assumes that each case is special and unique; the first level of analysis is being true to, respecting, and capturing the details of the individual cases being studied; cross-case analysis follows from and depends upon the quality of individual case studies. Inductive analysis -- immersion in the details and specifics of the data to discover important patterns, themes, and inter-relationships; begins by exploring, then confirming findings, guided by analytical principles rather than rules. Holistic perspective -- the whole phenomenon under study is understood as a complex system that is more than the sum of its parts; the focus is on complex interdependencies and system dynamics that cannot be reduced in any meaningful way to linear, cause and effect relationships and/or a few discrete variables. Context sensitive -- places findings in a social, historical, and temporal context; researcher is careful about [even dubious of] the possibility or meaningfulness of generalizations across time and space; emphasizes careful comparative case study analysis and extrapolating patterns for possible transferability and adaptation in new settings. Voice, perspective, and reflexivity -- the qualitative methodologist owns and is reflective about her or his own voice and perspective; a credible voice conveys authenticity and trustworthiness; complete objectivity being impossible and pure subjectivity undermining credibility, the researcher's focus reflects a balance between understanding and depicting the world authentically in all its complexity and of being self-analytical, politically aware, and reflexive in consciousness.

            "box_content": "The word qualitative implies an emphasis on the qualities of entities and on processes and meanings that are not experimentally examined or measured [if measured at all] in terms of quantity, amount, intensity, or frequency. Qualitative researchers stress the socially constructed nature of reality, the intimate relationship between the researcher and what is studied, and the situational constraints that shape inquiry. Such researchers emphasize the value-laden nature of inquiry. They seek answers to questions that stress how social experience is created and given meaning. In contrast, quantitative studies emphasize the measurement and analysis of causal relationships between variables, not processes. Qualitative forms of inquiry are considered by many social and behavioral scientists to be as much a perspective on how to approach investigating a research problem as it is a method. Denzin, Norman.

            "box_content": "It is very much true that most of the limitations you find in using qualitative research techniques also reflect their inherent strengths . For example, small sample sizes help you investigate research problems in a comprehensive and in-depth manner. However, small sample sizes undermine opportunities to draw useful generalizations from, or to make broad policy recommendations based upon, the findings. Additionally, as the primary instrument of investigation, qualitative researchers are often embedded in the cultures and experiences of others. However, cultural embeddedness increases the opportunity for bias generated from conscious or unconscious assumptions about the study setting to enter into how data is gathered, interpreted, and reported. Some specific limitations associated with using qualitative methods to study research problems in the social sciences include the following: Drifting away from the original objectives of the study in response to the changing nature of the context under which the research is conducted; Arriving at different conclusions based on the same information depending on the personal characteristics of the researcher; Replication of a study is very difficult; Research using human subjects increases the chance of ethical dilemmas that undermine the overall validity of the study; An inability to investigate causality between different research phenomena; Difficulty in explaining differences in the quality and quantity of information obtained from different respondents and arriving at different, non-consistent conclusions; Data gathering and analysis is often time consuming and/or expensive; Requires a high level of experience from the researcher to obtain the targeted information from the respondent; May lack consistency and reliability because the researcher can employ different probing techniques and the respondent can choose to tell some particular stories and ignore others; and, Generation of a significant amount of data that cannot be randomized into manageable parts for analysis.

            "box_content": "Before designing a quantitative research study, you must decide whether it will be descriptive or experimental because this will dictate how you gather, analyze, and interpret the results. A descriptive study is governed by the following rules: subjects are generally measured once; the intention is to only establish associations between variables; and, the study may include a sample population of hundreds or thousands of subjects to ensure that a valid estimate of a generalized relationship between variables has been obtained. An experimental design includes subjects measured before and after a particular treatment, the sample population may be very small and purposefully chosen, and it is intended to establish causality between variables. Introduction The introduction to a quantitative study is usually written in the present tense and from the third person point of view. It covers the following information: Identifies the research problem -- as with any academic study, you must state clearly and concisely the research problem being investigated. Reviews the literature -- review scholarship on the topic, synthesizing key themes and, if necessary, noting studies that have used similar methods of inquiry and analysis. Note where key gaps exist and how your study helps to fill these gaps or clarifies existing knowledge. Describes the theoretical framework -- provide an outline of the theory or hypothesis underpinning your study. If necessary, define unfamiliar or complex terms, concepts, or ideas and provide the appropriate background information to place the research problem in proper context [e.g., historical, cultural, economic, etc.]. Methodology The methods section of a quantitative study should describe how each objective of your study will be achieved. Be sure to provide enough detail to enable the reader can make an informed assessment of the methods being used to obtain results associated with the research problem. The methods section should be presented in the past tense. Study population and sampling -- where did the data come from; how robust is it; note where gaps exist or what was excluded. Note the procedures used for their selection; Data collection \u2013 describe the tools and methods used to collect information and identify the variables being measured; describe the methods used to obtain the data; and, note if the data was pre-existing [i.e., government data] or you gathered it yourself. If you gathered it yourself, describe what type of instrument you used and why. Note that no data set is perfect--describe any limitations in methods of gathering data. Data analysis -- describe the procedures for processing and analyzing the data. If appropriate, describe the specific instruments of analysis used to study each research objective, including mathematical techniques and the type of computer software used to manipulate the data. Results The finding of your study should be written objectively and in a succinct and precise format. In quantitative studies, it is common to use graphs, tables, charts, and other non-textual elements to help the reader understand the data. Make sure that non-textual elements do not stand in isolation from the text but are being used to supplement the overall description of the results and to help clarify key points being made. Further information about how to effectively present data using charts and graphs can be found here . Statistical analysis -- how did you analyze the data? What were the key findings from the data? The findings should be present in a logical, sequential order. Describe but do not interpret these trends or negative results; save that for the discussion section. The results should be presented in the past tense. Discussion Discussions should be analytic, logical, and comprehensive. The discussion should meld together your findings in relation to those identified in the literature review, and placed within the context of the theoretical framework underpinning the study. The discussion should be presented in the present tense. Interpretation of results -- reiterate the research problem being investigated and compare and contrast the findings with the research questions underlying the study. Did they affirm predicted outcomes or did the data refute it? Description of trends, comparison of groups, or relationships among variables -- describe any trends that emerged from your analysis and explain all unanticipated and statistical insignificant findings. Discussion of implications \u2013 what is the meaning of your results? Highlight key findings based on the overall results and note findings that you believe are important. How have the results helped fill gaps in understanding the research problem? Limitations -- describe any limitations or unavoidable bias in your study and, if necessary, note why these limitations did not inhibit effective interpretation of the results. Conclusion End your study by to summarizing the topic and provide a final comment and assessment of the study. Summary of findings \u2013 synthesize the answers to your research questions. Do not report any statistical data here; just provide a narrative summary of the key findings and describe what was learned that you did not know before conducting the study. Recommendations \u2013 if appropriate to the aim of the assignment, tie key findings with policy recommendations or actions to be taken in practice. Future research \u2013 note the need for future research linked to your study\u2019s limitations or to any remaining gaps in the literature that were not addressed in your study. Black, Thomas R.

            "box_content": "Your goal in conducting quantitative research study is to determine the relationship between one thing [an independent variable] and another [a dependent or outcome variable] within a population. Quantitative research designs are either descriptive [subjects usually measured once] or experimental [subjects measured before and after a treatment]. A descriptive study establishes only associations between variables; an experimental study establishes causality. Quantitative research deals in numbers, logic, and an objective stance. Quantitative research focuses on numeric and unchanging data and detailed, convergent reasoning rather than divergent reasoning [i.e., the generation of a variety of ideas about a research problem in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner]. Its main characteristics are : The data is usually gathered using structured research instruments. The results are based on larger sample sizes that are representative of the population. The research study can usually be replicated or repeated, given its high reliability. Researcher has a clearly defined research question to which objective answers are sought. All aspects of the study are carefully designed before data is collected. Data are in the form of numbers and statistics, often arranged in tables, charts, figures, or other non-textual forms. Project can be used to generalize concepts more widely, predict future results, or investigate causal relationships. Researcher uses tools, such as questionnaires or computer software, to collect numerical data. The overarching aim of a quantitative research study is to classify features, count them, and construct statistical models in an attempt to explain what is observed. Things to keep in mind when reporting the results of a study using quantitative methods : Explain the data collected and their statistical treatment as well as all relevant results in relation to the research problem you are investigating. Interpretation of results is not appropriate in this section. Report unanticipated events that occurred during your data collection. Explain how the actual analysis differs from the planned analysis. Explain your handling of missing data and why any missing data does not undermine the validity of your analysis. Explain the techniques you used to \"clean\" your data set. Choose a minimally sufficient statistical procedure ; provide a rationale for its use and a reference for it. Specify any computer programs used. Describe the assumptions for each procedure and the steps you took to ensure that they were not violated. When using inferential statistics , provide the descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and sample sizes for each variable as well as the value of the test statistic, its direction, the degrees of freedom, and the significance level [report the actual p value]. Avoid inferring causality , particularly in nonrandomized designs or without further experimentation. Use tables to provide exact values ; use figures to convey global effects. Keep figures small in size; include graphic representations of confidence intervals whenever possible. Always tell the reader what to look for in tables and figures . NOTE: When using pre-existing statistical data gathered and made available by anyone other than yourself [e.g., government agency], you still must report on the methods that were used to gather the data and describe any missing data that exists and, if there is any, provide a clear explanation why the missing data does not undermine the validity of your final analysis.

As a consequence, the results of quantitative research may be statistically significant but are often humanly insignificant. Some specific limitations associated with using quantitative methods to study research problems in the social sciences include: Quantitative data is more efficient and able to test hypotheses, but may miss contextual detail; Uses a static and rigid approach and so employs an inflexible process of discovery; The development of standard questions by researchers can lead to \"structural bias\" and false representation, where the data actually reflects the view of the researcher instead of the participating subject; Results provide less detail on behavior, attitudes, and motivation; Researcher may collect a much narrower and sometimes superficial dataset; Results are limited as they provide numerical descriptions rather than detailed narrative and generally provide less elaborate accounts of human perception; The research is often carried out in an unnatural, artificial environment so that a level of control can be applied to the exercise. This level of control might not normally be in place in the real world thus yielding \"laboratory results\" as opposed to \"real world results\"; and, Preset answers will not necessarily reflect how people really feel about a subject and, in some cases, might just be the closest match to the preconceived hypothesis.

Among the specific strengths of using quantitative methods to study social science research problems: Allows for a broader study, involving a greater number of subjects, and enhancing the generalization of the results; Allows for greater objectivity and accuracy of results. Generally, quantitative methods are designed to provide summaries of data that support generalizations about the phenomenon under study. In order to accomplish this, quantitative research usually involves few variables and many cases, and employs prescribed procedures to ensure validity and reliability; Applying well established standards means that the research can be replicated, and then analyzed and compared with similar studies; You can summarize vast sources of information and make comparisons across categories and over time; and, Personal bias can be avoided by keeping a 'distance' from participating subjects and using accepted computational techniques .

            "box_content": "When is it Important to Read the Entire Article or Research Paper Laubepin argues, \"Very few articles in a field are so important that every word needs to be read carefully.\" However, this implies that some studies are worth reading carefully. As painful and time-consuming as it may seem, there are valid reasons for reading a study in its entirety. Here are some examples: Studies Published Very Recently -- the author(s) of a well written study will provide a survey of the most important or impactful prior research in the literature review section. This can lay a foundation for understanding how scholars in the past addressed the research problem. In addition, the most recently published sources will highlight what is currently known and what gaps in understanding currently exist about a topic, usually in the form of the need for further research in the conclusion] . Surveys of the Research Problem -- some papers provide a comprehensive analytical overview of the research problem. Reading this type of study can help you understand underlying issues and discover why scholars have chosen to investigate the topic. This is particularly important if the study was published very recently because the author(s) should cite all or most of the key prior research on the topic. Note that, if it is a long-standing problem, there may be studies that specifically review the literature to identify gaps that remain. These studies often include the word review in their title [e.g., H\u00fcgel, Stephan, and Anna R. Davies. \"Public Participation, Engagement, and Climate Change Adaptation: A Review of the Research Literature.\" Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change 11 (2020): https://doi.org/10.1002/ wcc.645]. Highly Cited -- if you keep coming across the same citation to a study, this implies it was foundational in establishing an understanding of the research problem or the study had a significant impact within the literature [positive or negative]. Carefully reading a highly cited source can help you understand how the topic emerged and motivated scholars to further investigate the problem. Historical Overview -- knowing the historical background of a research problem may not be the focus of your analysis, but carefully reading a study that provides a thorough description and analysis of the history behind an event, issue, or phenomenon can add important context to understanding the topic and what aspect of the problem you may want to examine further. Innovative Design -- some studies are significant because the author(s) designed a unique or innovative approach to researching the problem. This may justify reading the entire study because it can motivate you to think creatively about pursuing an alternative or non-traditional approach to examining your topic of interest. Cross-disciplinary Approach -- reviewing studies produced outside of your discipline is an essential component of investigating research problems in the social sciences. Consider reading a study that was conducted by author(s) based in a different discipline [e.g., an anthropologist studying political cultures; a study of hiring practices in companies published in a sociology journal]. This approach can generate a new understanding or a unique perspective about the topic . Laubepin, Frederique. How to Read (and Understand) a Social Science Journal Article .

            "box_title": "Reading a Scholarly Article or Research Paper",
            "box_content": "Identifying a research problem to investigate usually requires a preliminary search for and review of the literature so as to gain an understanding about how scholars have examined a topic. Scholars rarely structure research studies in a way that can be followed like a story; they are complex and detail-intensive and often written in a descriptive and conclusive narrative form. However, in the social and behavioral sciences, journal articles and stand-alone research reports are generally organized in a consistent format that makes it easier to compare and contrast studies and to interpret their contents. General Reading Strategies W hen you first read an article or research paper, focus on asking specific questions about each section. This strategy can help with overall comprehension and with understanding how the content relates [or does not relate] to the problem you want to investigate. As you review more and more studies, the process of understanding and critically evaluating the research will become easier because the content of what you review will begin to coalescence around common themes and patterns of analysis. Below are recommendations on how to read each section of a research paper effectively. Note that the sections to read are out of order from how you will find them organized in a journal article or research paper. 1.\u00a0 Abstract The abstract summarizes the background, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions of a scholarly article or research paper. Use the abstract to filter out sources that may have appeared useful when you began searching for information but, in reality, are not relevant. Questions to consider when reading the abstract are: Is this study related to my question or area of research? What is this study about and why is it being done ? What is the working hypothesis or underlying thesis? What is the primary finding of the study? Are there words or terminology that I can use to either narrow or broaden the parameters of my search for more information? 2.\u00a0 Introduction If, after reading the abstract, you believe the paper may be useful, focus on examining the research problem and identifying the questions the author is trying to address. This information is usually located within the first few paragraphs of the introduction. Look for information about how and in what way this relates to what you are investigating. In addition to the research problem, the introduction should provide the main argument and theoretical framework of the study and, in the last paragraphs of the introduction, describe what the author(s) intend to accomplish.\u00a0Questions to consider when reading the introduction include: What is this study trying to prove or disprove? What is the author(s) trying to test or demonstrate? What do we already know about this topic and what gaps does this study try to fill or contribute a new understanding to the research problem? Why should I care about what is being investigated? Will this study tell me anything new related to the research problem I am investigating? 3.\u00a0 Literature Review The literature review describes what is already known about a topic. Read the literature review to obtain a big picture perspective about how the topic has been studied and to begin the process of seeing where your potential study fits within this domain of prior research. Questions to consider when reading the literature review include: W hat other research has been conducted about this topic and what are the main themes that have emerged? What does prior research reveal about what is already known about the topic and what remains to be discovered? What have been the most important past findings about the research problem? How has prior research led the author(s) to conduct this particular study? Is there any prior research that is unique or groundbreaking? Are there any studies I could use as a model for designing and organizing my own study? 4.\u00a0 Discussion/Conclusion The discussion and conclusion are usually the last two sections of text in a scholarly article or research report. They reveal how the author(s) interpreted the findings of their research and presented recommendations or courses of action based on those findings. Often in the conclusion, the author(s) highlight recommendations for further research that can be used to develop your own study. Questions to consider when reading the discussion and conclusion sections include: What is the overall meaning of the study and why is this important? [i.e., how have the author(s) addressed the \" So What? \" question]. What do you find to be the most important ways that the findings have been interpreted? What are the weaknesses in their argument? Do you believe conclusions about the significance of the study and its findings are valid? What limitations of the study do the author(s) describe and how might this help formulate my own research? Does the conclusion contain any recommendations for future research? 5.\u00a0 Methods/Methodology The methods section describes the materials, techniques, and procedures for gathering information used to examine the research problem. If what you have read so far closely supports your understanding of the topic, then move on to examining how the author(s) gathered information during the research process. Questions to consider when reading the methods section include: Did the study use qualitative [based on interviews, observations, content analysis], quantitative [based on statistical analysis], or a mixed-methods approach to examining the research problem? What was the type of information or data used? Could this method of analysis be repeated and can I adopt the same approach? Is enough information available to repeat the study or should new data be found to expand or improve understanding of the research problem? 6.\u00a0 Results After reading the above sections, you should have a clear understanding of the general findings of the study. Therefore, read the results section to identify how key findings were discussed in relation to the research problem. If any non-textual elements [e.g., graphs, charts, tables, etc.] are confusing, focus on the explanations about them in the text. Questions to consider when reading the results section include: W hat did the author(s) find and how did they find it? Does the author(s) highlight any findings as most significant? Are the results presented in a factual and unbiased way? Does the analysis of results in the discussion section agree with how the results are presented? Is all the data present and did the author(s) adequately address gaps? What conclusions do you formulate from this data and does it match with the author's conclusions? 7.\u00a0 References The references list the sources used by the author(s) to document what prior research and information was used when conducting the study. After reviewing the article or research paper, use the references to identify additional sources of information on the topic and to examine critically how these sources supported the overall research agenda. Questions to consider when reading the references include: Do the sources cited by the author(s) reflect a diversity of disciplinary viewpoints, i.e., are the sources all from a particular field of study or do the sources reflect multiple areas of study? Are there any unique or interesting sources that could be incorporated into my study? What other authors are respected in this field, i.e., who has multiple works cited or is cited most often by others? What other research should I review to clarify any remaining issues or that I need more information about? NOTE :\u00a0 A final strategy in reviewing research is to copy and paste the title of the source [journal article, book, research report] into Google Scholar . If it appears, look for a \"cited by\" followed by a hyperlinked number [e.g., Cited by 45]. This number indicates how many times the study has been subsequently cited in other, more recently published works. This can be an effective means of expanding your review of pertinent literature based on a study you have found useful. The same strategies described above can be applied to reading articles you find in the list of cited by references. Anatomy of a Scholarly Article (Interactive Tutorial.

            "box_content": "Specific Reading Strategies Effectively reading scholarly research is an acquired skill that involves attention to detail and an ability to comprehend complex ideas, data, and theoretical concepts in a way that applies logically to the research problem you are investigating. Here are some specific reading strategies to consider. As You are Reading Focus on information that is most relevant to the research problem; skim over the other parts. As noted above, read content out of order! This isn't a novel; you want to start with the spoiler to quickly assess the relevance of the study. Think critically about what you read and seek to build your own arguments; not everything may be entirely valid, examined effectively, or thoroughly investigated. Look up the definitions of unfamiliar words, concepts, or terminology. A good scholarly source is Credo Reference . Highlighting Key Points and Taking Notes Taking notes as you read will save time when you go back to examine your sources. Here are some suggestions: Mark or highlight important text as you read [e.g., you can use the highlight text feature in a PDF document] Take notes in the margins [e.g., Adobe Reader offers pop-up\u00a0sticky notes]. Highlight important quotations; consider using different colors to differentiate between quotes and other types of important text. Summarize key points about the study at the end of the paper. To save time, these can be in the form of a concise bulleted list of statements [e.g., intro has provides historical background; lit review has important sources; good conclusions]. Reflecting on What You Have Read Write down thoughts that come to mind that may help clarify your understanding of the research problem. Here are some examples of questions to ask yourself: Do I understand all of the terminology and key concepts? Do I understand the parts of this study most relevant to my topic? What specific problem does the research address and why is it important? Are there any issues or perspectives the author(s) did not consider? Do I have any reason to question the validity or reliability of this research? How do the findings relate to my research interests and to other works which I have read?

The series attempts to take a learner-centered approach, by addressing live questions students face during the research process, and aims to provide direct interventions on these skills. The videos, wherever possible, are informed by research on the writing process, evidence-based learning theory, and instructional design practices in order to make this tacit knowledge explicit for learners and instructors. Getting Started on a Research Paper (Using Divergent Thinking) Students often say that getting started is the hardest part of the research process. This may be, in part, because whereas most of our education teaches convergent thinking strategies (developing answers to linear questions with fixed answers and solutions), the research process requires a kind of creative, or \u201cdivergent\u201d kind of thinking, where we consider multiple potential solutions for an open-ended problem. This video explains how students can use divergent thinking to interpret an assignment creatively and select a meaningful, authentic topic of interest. Building Stronger Arguments Students are often expected to build strong arguments in their research. But what does an instructor mean when they ask that of their students? What does a strong argument actually look like ? This video draws on strategies from philosophy, critical thinking, and learning theory to help students use research to build stronger arguments in their writing. Critical Reading Strategies for Research Instructors often ask students to engage more deeply with sources when doing research and writing. But what does that mean , exactly? This video draws on educational psychology and instructional design theory to give students concrete strategies for engaging deeply and meaningfully with sources by asking \u201cEssential questions\u201d about the readings. Time Management and the Writing Process In order to do quality research, one must have a good grasp of time management. Research presents unique time management challenges, since it is a recursive process that often requires one to go back to earlier steps in the process even after that part of the research process seems \u201cdone.\u201d This video outlines linear vs. recursive processes, how the research process falls under the latter heading, and maps research as a linear process so students have a better grasp of what to expect when engaging in research and planning their time."

Popular sources -- intended for a general audience of readers, they are written typically to entertain,\u00a0inform, or persuade. Popular sources help you answer who, what, when, and where questions and are essential for finding information about current events or issues. Popular sources range from research-oriented [but lacking complete citations to sources] to special interest, agenda-driven publications. Trade publications -- intended to share general news, trends, and opinions among practitioners in a certain industry or profession. Although generally written by experts, they are not considered scholarly because they are not peer-reviewed [i.e., critically evaluated before publication by experts in the field] and do not focus on\u00a0advancing new knowledge discovery or reporting research results. Trade journals, however, are an essential source of information about emerging issues in the field of business and specialized industries [e.g., tourism, environmental studies, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.].

            "box_content": "To do research, you must cite research. Primary sources do not represent research per se, but only the artifacts from which most research is derived. Therefore, the majority of sources in a literature review are secondary sources that present research findings, analysis, and the evaluation of other researcher's works. Reviewing secondary source material can be of valu e in improving your overall research paper because secondary sources facilitate the communication of what is known about a topic. This literature also helps you understand the level of uncertainty about what is currently known and what additional information is needed from further research. It is important to note, however, that secondary sources are not the subject of your analysis. Instead, they represent various opinions, interpretations, and arguments about the research problem you are investigating--opinions, interpretations, and arguments with which you may either agree or disagree with as part of your own analysis of the literature. Examples of secondary sources you could review as part of your overall study include: * Bibliographies [also considered tertiary] * Biographical works * Books, other than fiction and autobiography * Commentaries, criticisms * Dictionaries, Encyclopedias [also considered tertiary] * Histories * Journal articles [depending on the discipline, they can be primary] * Magazine and newspaper articles [this distinction varies by discipline] * Textbooks [also considered tertiary] * Web site [also considered primary]"

His model attempts to explain and describe the organizational pattern of writing the introduction to scholarly research studies. Following the C.A.R.S. Model can be useful approach because it can help you to: 1) begin the writing process [getting started is often the most difficult task]; 2) understand the way in which an introduction sets the stage for the rest of your paper; and, 3) assess how the introduction fits within the larger scope of your study. The model assumes that writers follow a general organizational pattern in response to two types of challenges [\u201ccompetitions\u201d] relating to establishing a presence within a particular domain of research: 1) the competition to create a rhetorical space and, 2) the competition to attract readers into that space. The model proposes three actions [Swales calls them \u201cmoves\u201d], accompanied by specific steps, that reflect the development of an effective introduction for a research paper. These \u201cmoves\u201d and steps can be used as a template for writing the introduction to your own social sciences research papers. \"Introductions.\" The Writing Lab and The OWL.

The steps taken to achieve this would be: Step 1 -- Claiming importance of, and/or\u00a0 [writing action = describing the research problem and providing evidence to support why the topic is important to study] Step 2 -- Making topic generalizations, and/or\u00a0 [writing action = providing statements about the current state of knowledge, consensus, practice or description of phenomena] Step 3 -- Reviewing items of previous research\u00a0 [writing action = synthesize prior research that further supports the need to study the research problem; this is not a literature review but more a reflection of key studies that have touched upon but perhaps not fully addressed the topic] Move 2: Establishing a Niche [the problem] This action refers to making a clear and cogent argument that your particular piece of research is important and possesses value. This can be done by indicating a specific gap in previous research, by challenging a broadly accepted assumption, by raising a question, a hypothesis, or need, or by extending previous knowledge in some way. The steps taken to achieve this would be: Step 1a -- Counter-claiming, or\u00a0 [writing action = introduce an opposing viewpoint or perspective or identify a gap in prior research that you believe has weakened or undermined the prevailing argument] Step 1b -- Indicating a gap, or\u00a0 [writing action = develop the research problem around a gap or understudied area of the literature] Step 1c -- Question-raising, or\u00a0 [writing action = similar to gap identification, this involves presenting key questions about the consequences of gaps in prior research that will be addressed by your study. For example, one could state, \u201cDespite prior observations of voter behavior in local elections in urban Detroit, it remains unclear why do some single mothers choose to avoid....\u201d] Step 1d -- Continuing a tradition\u00a0 [writing action = extend prior research to expand upon or clarify a research problem. This is often signaled with logical connecting terminology, such as, \u201chence,\u201d \u201ctherefore,\u201d \u201cconsequently,\u201d \u201cthus\u201d or language that indicates a need. For example, one could state, \u201cConsequently, these factors need to examined in more detail....\u201d or \u201cEvidence suggests an interesting correlation, therefore, it is desirable to survey different respondents....\u201d] Move 3: Occupying the Niche [the solution] The final \"move\" is to announce the means by which your study will contribute new knowledge or new understanding in contrast to prior research on the topic. This is also where you describe the remaining organizational structure of the paper. The steps taken to achieve this would be: Step 1a -- Outlining purposes, or\u00a0 [writing action = answering the \u201cSo What?\u201d question. Explain in clear language the objectives of your study] Step 1b -- Announcing present research [writing action = describe the purpose of your study in terms of what the research is going to do or accomplish. In the social sciences, the \u201cSo What?\u201d question still needs to addressed] Step 2 -- Announcing principle findings\u00a0 [writing action = present a brief, general summary of key findings written, such as, \u201cThe findings indicate a need for...,\u201d or \u201cThe research suggests four approaches to....\u201d] Step 3 -- Indicating article structure\u00a0 [writing action = state how the remainder of your paper is organized] \"Introductions.\" The Writing Lab and The OWL.

The purpose of using these words is to draw a clear distinction between perceived deficiencies in previous studies and the research you are presenting that is intended to help resolve these deficiencies. Below is a table of common words used by authors. Contrast Quantity Verbs Adjectives albeit although but howbeit however nevertheless notwithstanding unfortunately whereas yet few handful less little no none not challenge deter disregard exclude fail hinder ignore lack limit misinterpret neglect obviate omit overlook prevent question restrict difficult dubious elusive inadequate incomplete inconclusive inefficacious ineffective inefficient questionable scarce uncertain unclear unconvincing unproductive unreliable unsatisfactory NOTE : You may prefer not to adopt a negative stance in your writing when placing it within the context of prior research. In such cases, an alternative approach is to utilize a neutral, contrastive statement that expresses a new perspective without giving the appearance of trying to diminish the validity of other people's research. Examples of how this can be achieved include the following statements, with A representing the findings of prior research, B representing your research problem, and X representing one or more variables that have been investigated. Prior\u00a0 research has focused on A, rather than on B... Prior research into A can be useful but to counterbalance X, it is important to consider B... These studies have emphasized A, as opposed to B... While prior studies have examined A, it may be preferable to contemplate the impact of B... After consideration of A, it is important to also recognize B... The study of A has been exhaustive, but changing circumstances related to X support the need for examining [or revisiting] B... Although considerable research has been devoted to A, less attention has been paid to B... Earlier research offers insight into the need for A, though consideration of B is also helpful...

Anchors the research questions, hypotheses, or assumptions to follow . It offers a concise statement about the purpose of your paper. Place the topic into a particular context that defines the parameters of what is to be investigated. Provide the framework for reporting the results and indicates what is probably necessary to conduct the study and explain how the findings will present this information. So What? In the social sciences, the research problem establishes the means by which you must answer the \"So What?\" question. This declarative question refers to a research problem surviving the relevancy test [the quality of a measurement procedure that provides repeatability and accuracy]. Note that answering the \"So What?\" question requires a commitment on your part to not only show that you have reviewed the literature, but that you have thoroughly considered the significance of the research problem and its implications applied to creating new knowledge and understanding or informing practice. To survive the \"So What\" question, problem statements should possess the following attributes: Clarity and precision [a well-written statement does not make sweeping generalizations and irresponsible pronouncements; it also does include unspecific determinates like \"very\" or \"giant\"], Demonstrate a researchable topic or issue [i.e., feasibility of conducting the study is based upon access to information that can be effectively acquired, gathered, interpreted, synthesized, and understood], Identification of what would be studied, while avoiding the use of value-laden words and terms, Identification of an overarching question or small set of questions accompanied by key factors or variables, Identification of key concepts and terms, Articulation of the study's conceptual boundaries or parameters or limitations, Some generalizability in regards to applicability and bringing results into general use, Conveyance of the study's importance, benefits, and justification [i.e., regardless of the type of research, it is important to demonstrate that the research is not trivial], Does not have unnecessary jargon or overly complex sentence constructions; and, Conveyance of more than the mere gathering of descriptive data providing only a snapshot of the issue or phenomenon under investigation.

            "box_content": "I.\u00a0 Types and Content There are four general conceptualizations of a research problem in the social sciences: Casuist Research Problem -- this type of problem relates to the determination of right and wrong in questions of conduct or conscience by analyzing moral dilemmas through the application of general rules and the careful distinction of special cases. Difference Research Problem -- typically asks the question, \u201cIs there a difference between two or more groups or treatments?\u201d This type of problem statement is used when the researcher compares or contrasts two or more phenomena. This a common approach to defining a problem in the clinical social sciences or behavioral sciences. Descriptive Research Problem -- typically asks the question, \"what is...?\" with the underlying purpose to describe the significance of a situation, state, or existence of a specific phenomenon. This problem is often associated with revealing hidden or understudied issues. Relational Research Problem -- suggests a relationship of some sort between two or more variables to be investigated. The underlying purpose is to investigate specific qualities or characteristics that may be connected in some way. A problem statement in the social sciences should contain : A lead-in that helps ensure the reader will maintain interest over the study, A declaration of originality [e.g., mentioning a knowledge void or a lack of clarity about a topic that will be revealed in the literature review of prior research], An indication of the central focus of the study [establishing the boundaries of analysis], and An explanation of the study's significance or the benefits to be derived from investigating the research problem. NOTE : A statement describing the research problem of your paper should not be viewed as a thesis statement that you may be familiar with from high school. Given the content listed above, a description of the research problem is usually a short paragraph in length. II.\u00a0 Sources of Problems for Investigation The identification of a problem to study can be challenging, not because there's a lack of issues that could be investigated, but due to the challenge of formulating an academically relevant and researchable problem which is unique and does not simply duplicate the work of others. To facilitate how you might select a problem from which to build a research study, consider these sources of inspiration: Deductions from Theory This relates to deductions made from social philosophy or generalizations embodied in life and in society that the researcher is familiar with. These deductions from human behavior are then placed within an empirical frame of reference through research. From a theory, the researcher can formulate a research problem or hypothesis stating the expected findings in certain empirical situations. The research asks the question: \u201cWhat relationship between variables will be observed if theory aptly summarizes the state of affairs?\u201d One can then design and carry out a systematic investigation to assess whether empirical data confirm or reject the hypothesis, and hence, the theory. Interdisciplinary Perspectives Identifying a problem that forms the basis for a research study can come from academic movements and scholarship originating in disciplines outside of your primary area of study. This can be an intellectually stimulating exercise. A review of pertinent literature should include examining research from related disciplines that can reveal new avenues of exploration and analysis. An interdisciplinary approach to selecting a research problem offers an opportunity to construct a more comprehensive understanding of a very complex issue that any single discipline may be able to provide. Interviewing Practitioners The identification of research problems about particular topics can arise from formal interviews or informal discussions with practitioners who provide insight into new directions for future research and how to make research findings more relevant to practice. Discussions with experts in the field, such as, teachers, social workers, health care providers, lawyers, business leaders, etc., offers the chance to identify practical, \u201creal world\u201d problems that may be understudied or ignored within academic circles. This approach also provides some practical knowledge which may help in the process of designing and conducting your study. Personal Experience Don't undervalue your everyday experiences or encounters as worthwhile problems for investigation. Think critically about your own experiences and/or frustrations with an issue facing society or related to your community, your neighborhood, your family, or your personal life. This can be derived, for example, from deliberate observations of certain relationships for which there is no clear explanation or witnessing an event that appears harmful to a person or group or that is out of the ordinary. Relevant Literature The selection of a research problem can be derived from a thorough review of pertinent research associated with your overall area of interest. This may reveal where gaps exist in understanding a topic or where an issue has been understudied. Research may be conducted to: 1) fill such gaps in knowledge; 2) evaluate if the methodologies employed in prior studies can be adapted to solve other problems; or, 3) determine if a similar study could be conducted in a different subject area or applied in a different context or to different study sample [i.e., different setting or different group of people]. Also, authors frequently conclude their studies by noting implications for further research; read the conclusion of pertinent studies because statements about further research can be a valuable source for identifying new problems to investigate. The fact that a researcher has identified a topic worthy of further exploration validates the fact it is worth pursuing. III.\u00a0 What Makes a Good Research Statement? A good problem statement begins by introducing the broad area in which your research is centered, gradually leading the reader to the more specific issues you are investigating. The statement need not be lengthy, but a good research problem should incorporate the following features: 1.\u00a0 Compelling Topic The problem chosen should be one that motivates you to address it but simple curiosity is not a good enough reason to pursue a research study because this does not indicate significance. The problem that you choose to explore must be important to you, but it must also be viewed as important by your readers and to a the larger academic and/or social community that could be impacted by the results of your study. 2.\u00a0 Supports Multiple Perspectives The problem must be phrased in a way that avoids dichotomies and instead supports the generation and exploration of multiple perspectives. A general rule of thumb in the social sciences is that a good research problem is one that would generate a variety of viewpoints from a composite audience made up of reasonable people. 3.\u00a0 Researchability This isn't a real word but it represents an important aspect of creating a good research statement. It seems a bit obvious, but you don't want to find yourself in the midst of investigating a complex research project and realize that you don't have enough prior research to draw from for your analysis. There's nothing inherently wrong with original research, but you must choose research problems that can be supported, in some way, by the resources available to you. If you are not sure if something is researchable, don't assume that it isn't if you don't find information right away--seek help from a librarian ! NOTE: Do not confuse a research problem with a research topic. A topic is something to read and obtain information about, whereas a problem is something to be solved or framed as a question raised for inquiry, consideration, or solution, or explained as a source of perplexity, distress, or vexation. In short, a research topic is something to be understood; a research problem is something that needs to be investigated. IV.\u00a0 Asking Analytical Questions about the Research Problem Research problems in the social and behavioral sciences are often analyzed around critical questions that must be investigated. These questions can be explicitly listed in the introduction [i.e., \"This study addresses three research questions about women's psychological recovery from domestic abuse in multi-generational home settings...\"], or, the questions are implied in the text as specific areas of study related to the research problem. Explicitly listing your research questions at the end of your introduction can help in designing a clear roadmap of what you plan to address in your study, whereas, implicitly integrating them into the text of the introduction allows you to create a more compelling narrative around the key issues under investigation. Either approach is appropriate. The number of questions you attempt to address should be based on the complexity of the problem you are investigating and what areas of inquiry you find most critical to study. Practical considerations, such as, the length of the paper you are writing or the availability of resources to analyze the issue can also factor in how many questions to ask. In general, however, there should be no more than four research questions underpinning a single research problem. Given this, well-developed analytical questions can focus on any of the following: Highlights a genuine dilemma, area of ambiguity, or point of confusion about a topic open to interpretation by your readers; Yields an answer that is unexpected and not obvious rather than inevitable and self-evident; Provokes meaningful thought or discussion; Raises the visibility of the key ideas or concepts that may be understudied or hidden; Suggests the need for complex analysis or argument rather than a basic description or summary; and, Offers a specific path of inquiry that avoids eliciting generalizations about the problem. NOTE: Questions of how and why concerning a research problem often require more analysis than questions about who, what, where, and when. You should still ask yourself these latter questions, however. Thinking introspectively about the who, what, where, and when of a research problem can help ensure that you have thoroughly considered all aspects of the problem under investigation and helps define the scope of the study in relation to the problem. V.\u00a0 Mistakes to Avoid Beware of circular reasoning! Do not state the research problem as simply the absence of the thing you are suggesting. For example, if you propose the following, \"The problem in this community is that there is no hospital,\" this only leads to a research problem where: The need is for a hospital The objective is to create a hospital The method is to plan for building a hospital, and The evaluation is to measure if there is a hospital or not. This is an example of a research problem that fails the \"So What?\" test . In this example, the problem does not reveal the relevance of why you are investigating the fact there is no hospital in the community [e.g., perhaps there's a hospital in the community ten miles away]; it does not elucidate the significance of why one should study the fact there is no hospital in the community [e.g., that hospital in the community ten miles away has no emergency room]; the research problem does not offer an intellectual pathway towards adding new knowledge or clarifying prior knowledge [e.g., the county in which there is no hospital already conducted a study about the need for a hospital, but it was conducted ten years ago]; and, the problem does not offer meaningful outcomes that lead to recommendations that can be generalized for other situations or that could suggest areas for further research [e.g., the challenges of building a new hospital serves as a case study for other communities].

            "box_content": "The theoretical framework may be rooted in a specific theory , in which case, your work is expected to test the validity of that existing theory in relation to specific events, issues, or phenomena. Many social science research papers fit into this rubric. For example, Peripheral Realism Theory, which categorizes perceived differences among nation-states as those that give orders, those that obey, and those that rebel, could be used as a means for understanding conflicted relationships among countries in Africa. A test of this theory could be the following: Does Peripheral Realism Theory help explain intra-state actions, such as, the disputed split between southern and northern Sudan that led to the creation of two nations? However, you may not always be asked by your professor to test a specific theory in your paper, but to develop your own framework from which your analysis of the research problem is derived . Based upon the above example, it is perhaps easiest to understand the nature and function of a theoretical framework if it is viewed as an answer to two basic questions: What is the research problem/question? [e.g., \"How should the individual and the state relate during periods of conflict?\"] Why is your approach a feasible solution? [i.e., justify the application of your choice of a particular theory and explain why alternative constructs were rejected. I could choose instead to test Instrumentalist or Circumstantialists models developed among ethnic conflict theorists that rely upon socio-economic-political factors to explain individual-state relations and to apply this theoretical model to periods of war between nations]. The answers to these questions come from a thorough review of the literature and your course readings [summarized and analyzed in the next section of your paper] and the gaps in the research that emerge from the review process. With this in mind, a complete theoretical framework will likely not emerge until after you have completed a thorough review of the literature . Just as a research problem in your paper requires contextualization and background information, a theory requires a framework for understanding its application to the topic being investigated. When writing and revising this part of your research paper, keep in mind the following: Clearly describe the framework, concepts, models, or specific theories that underpin your study . This includes noting who the key theorists are in the field who have conducted research on the problem you are investigating and, when necessary, the historical context that supports the formulation of that theory. This latter element is particularly important if the theory is relatively unknown or it is borrowed from another discipline. Position your theoretical framework within a broader context of related frameworks, concepts, models, or theories . As noted in the example above, there will likely be several concepts, theories, or models that can be used to help develop a framework for understanding the research problem. Therefore, note why the theory you've chosen is the appropriate one. The present tense is used when writing about theory. Although the past tense can be used to describe the history of a theory or the role of key theorists, the construction of your theoretical framework is happening now. You should make your theoretical assumptions as explicit as possible . Later, your discussion of methodology should be linked back to this theoretical framework. Don\u2019t just take what the theory says as a given! Reality is never accurately represented in such a simplistic way; if you imply that it can be, you fundamentally distort a reader's ability to understand the findings that emerge. Given this, always note the limitations of the theoretical framework you've chosen [i.e., what parts of the research problem require further investigation because the theory inadequately explains a certain phenomena].

Some writers don't make the distinction between tertiary and secondary because both types of materials do not represent original works [primary sources]. However, for the purposes of reviewing the literature, it is important to understand how tiertiary sources can contribute to your overall search for relevant information about the research problem. Reviewing tertiary source material can be of value in improving your overall research paper because they: Often compile factual information in one place. Searching for the data in multiple sources takes time but searching for names of heads of state can be found in an almanac. Lead the reader to additional sources . For example, rather than citing in your literature review a long list of additional sources on a topic, you can simply cite to a comprehensive bibliography compiled by another researcher. Distill large quantities of closely related information or data [e.g., a statistical compendium]. Often contain references and bibliographies that can point you to key primary and secondary sources. Examples of tiertiary sources you could review as part of your overall study include: * Abstracts * Almanacs * Bibliographies [also considered secondary] * Chronologies * Dictionaries and encyclopedias [also considered secondary] * Directories * Fact books * Handbooks * Indexes, databases, search engines, and bibliographies used to locate primary and secondary sources * Manuals * Statistical compendiums * Textbooks and course readers [may also be secondary] Tertiary sources also include any type of user-contributed online resource such as Wikipedia."

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose The essentials of action research design follow a characteristic cycle whereby initially an exploratory stance is adopted, where an understanding of a problem is developed and plans are made for some form of interventionary strategy. Then the intervention is carried out [the \"action\" in action research] during which time, pertinent observations are collected in various forms. The new interventional strategies are carried out, and this cyclic process repeats, continuing until a sufficient understanding of [or a valid implementation solution for] the problem is achieved. The protocol is iterative or cyclical in nature and is intended to foster deeper understanding of a given situation, starting with conceptualizing and particularizing the problem and moving through several interventions and evaluations. What do these studies tell you ? This is a collaborative and adaptive research design that lends itself to use in work or community situations. Design focuses on pragmatic and solution-driven research outcomes rather than testing theories. When practitioners use action research, it has the potential to increase the amount they learn consciously from their experience; the action research cycle can be regarded as a learning cycle. Action research studies often have direct and obvious relevance to improving practice and advocating for change. There are no hidden controls or preemption of direction by the researcher. What these studies don't tell you ? It is harder to do than conducting conventional research because the researcher takes on responsibilities of advocating for change as well as for researching the topic. Action research is much harder to write up because it is less likely that you can use a standard format to report your findings effectively [i.e., data is often in the form of stories or observation]. Personal over-involvement of the researcher may bias research results. The cyclic nature of action research to achieve its twin outcomes of action [e.g. change] and research [e.g. understanding] is time-consuming and complex to conduct. Advocating for change usually requires buy-in from study participants. Coghlan, David and Mary Brydon-Miller. The Sage Encyclopedia of Action Research .

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose A case study is an in-depth study of a particular research problem rather than a sweeping statistical survey or comprehensive comparative inquiry. It is often used to narrow down a very broad field of research into one or a few easily researchable examples. The case study research design is also useful for testing whether a specific theory and model actually applies to phenomena in the real world. It is a useful design when not much is known about an issue or phenomenon. What do these studies tell you ? Approach excels at bringing us to an understanding of a complex issue through detailed contextual analysis of a limited number of events or conditions and their relationships. A researcher using a case study design can apply a variety of methodologies and rely on a variety of sources to investigate a research problem. Design can extend experience or add strength to what is already known through previous research. Social scientists, in particular, make wide use of this research design to examine contemporary real-life situations and provide the basis for the application of concepts and theories and the extension of methodologies. The design can provide detailed descriptions of specific and rare cases. What these studies don't tell you ? A single or small number of cases offers little basis for establishing reliability or to generalize the findings to a wider population of people, places, or things. Intense exposure to the study of a case may bias a researcher's interpretation of the findings. Design does not facilitate assessment of cause and effect relationships. Vital information may be missing, making the case hard to interpret. The case may not be representative or typical of the larger problem being investigated. If the criteria for selecting a case is because it represents a very unusual or unique phenomenon or problem for study, then your interpretation of the findings can only apply to that particular case.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Causality studies may be thought of as understanding a phenomenon in terms of conditional statements in the form, \u201cIf X, then Y.\u201d This type of research is used to measure what impact a specific change will have on existing norms and assumptions. Most social scientists seek causal explanations that reflect tests of hypotheses. Causal effect (nomothetic perspective) occurs when variation in one phenomenon, an independent variable, leads to or results, on average, in variation in another phenomenon, the dependent variable. Conditions necessary for determining causality: Empirical association -- a valid conclusion is based on finding an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. Appropriate time order -- to conclude that causation was involved, one must see that cases were exposed to variation in the independent variable before variation in the dependent variable. Nonspuriousness -- a relationship between two variables that is not due to variation in a third variable. What do these studies tell you ? Causality research designs assist researchers in understanding why the world works the way it does through the process of proving a causal link between variables and by the process of eliminating other possibilities. Replication is possible. There is greater confidence the study has internal validity due to the systematic subject selection and equity of groups being compared. What these studies don't tell you ? Not all relationships are causal! The possibility always exists that, by sheer coincidence, two unrelated events appear to be related [e.g., Punxatawney Phil could accurately predict the duration of Winter for five consecutive years but, the fact remains, he's just a big, furry rodent]. Conclusions about causal relationships are difficult to determine due to a variety of extraneous and confounding variables that exist in a social environment. This means causality can only be inferred, never proven. If two variables are correlated, the cause must come before the effect. However, even though two variables might be causally related, it can sometimes be difficult to determine which variable comes first and, therefore, to establish which variable is the actual cause and which is the\u00a0 actual effect.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Often used in the medical sciences, but also found in the applied social sciences, a cohort study generally refers to a study conducted over a period of time involving members of a population which the subject or representative member comes from, and who are united by some commonality or similarity. Using a quantitative framework, a cohort study makes note of statistical occurrence within a specialized subgroup, united by same or similar characteristics that are relevant to the research problem being investigated, rather than studying statistical occurrence within the general population. Using a qualitative framework, cohort studies generally gather data using methods of observation. Cohorts can be either \"open\" or \"closed.\" Open Cohort Studies [dynamic populations, such as the population of Los Angeles] involve a population that is defined just by the state of being a part of the study in question (and being monitored for the outcome). Date of entry and exit from the study is individually defined, therefore, the size of the study population is not constant. In open cohort studies, researchers can only calculate rate based data, such as, incidence rates and variants thereof. Closed Cohort Studies [static populations, such as patients entered into a clinical trial] involve participants who enter into the study at one defining point in time and where it is presumed that no new participants can enter the cohort. Given this, the number of study participants remains constant (or can only decrease). What do these studies tell you ? The use of cohorts is often mandatory because a randomized control study may be unethical. For example, you cannot deliberately expose people to asbestos, you can only study its effects on those who have already been exposed. Research that measures risk factors often relies upon cohort designs. Because cohort studies measure potential causes before the outcome has occurred, they can demonstrate that these \u201ccauses\u201d preceded the outcome, thereby avoiding the debate as to which is the cause and which is the effect. Cohort analysis is highly flexible and can provide insight into effects over time and related to a variety of different types of changes [e.g., social, cultural, political, economic, etc.]. Either original data or secondary data can be used in this design. What these studies don't tell you ? In cases where a comparative analysis of two cohorts is made [e.g., studying the effects of one group exposed to asbestos and one that has not], a researcher cannot control for all other factors that might differ between the two groups. These factors are known as confounding variables. Cohort studies can end up taking a long time to complete if the researcher must wait for the conditions of interest to develop within the group. This also increases the chance that key variables change during the course of the study, potentially impacting the validity of the findings. Due to the lack of randominization in the cohort design, its external validity is lower than that of study designs where the researcher randomly assigns participants.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Cross-sectional research designs have three distinctive features: no time dimension; a reliance on existing differences rather than change following intervention; and, groups are selected based on existing differences rather than random allocation. The cross-sectional design can only measure differences between or from among a variety of people, subjects, or phenomena rather than a process of change. As such, researchers using this design can only employ a relatively passive approach to making causal inferences based on findings. What do these studies tell you ? Cross-sectional studies provide a clear 'snapshot' of the outcome and the characteristics associated with it, at a specific point in time. Unlike an experimental design, where there is an active intervention by the researcher to produce and measure change or to create differences, cross-sectional designs focus on studying and drawing inferences from existing differences between people, subjects, or phenomena. Entails collecting data at and concerning one point in time. While longitudinal studies involve taking multiple measures over an extended period of time, cross-sectional research is focused on finding relationships between variables at one moment in time. Groups identified for study are purposely selected based upon existing differences in the sample rather than seeking random sampling. Cross-section studies are capable of using data from a large number of subjects and, unlike observational studies, is not geographically bound. Can estimate prevalence of an outcome of interest because the sample is usually taken from the whole population. Because cross-sectional designs generally use survey techniques to gather data, they are relatively inexpensive and take up little time to conduct. What these studies don't tell you ? Finding people, subjects, or phenomena to study that are very similar except in one specific variable can be difficult. Results are static and time bound and, therefore, give no indication of a sequence of events or reveal historical or temporal contexts. Studies cannot be utilized to establish cause and effect relationships. This design only provides a snapshot of analysis so there is always the possibility that a study could have differing results if another time-frame had been chosen. There is no follow up to the findings. Bethlehem, Jelke. \"7: Cross-sectional Research.\" In Research Methodology in the Social, Behavioural and Life Sciences .

Descriptive research is used to obtain information concerning the current status of the phenomena and to describe \"what exists\" with respect to variables or conditions in a situation. What do these studies tell you ? The subject is being observed in a completely natural and unchanged natural environment. True experiments, whilst giving analyzable data, often adversely influence the normal behavior of the subject [a.k.a., the Heisenberg effect whereby measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems]. Descriptive research is often used as a pre-cursor to more quantitative research designs with the general overview giving some valuable pointers as to what variables are worth testing quantitatively. If the limitations are understood, they can be a useful tool in developing a more focused study. Descriptive studies can yield rich data that lead to important recommendations in practice. Appoach collects a large amount of data for detailed analysis. What these studies don't tell you ? The results from a descriptive research cannot be used to discover a definitive answer or to disprove a hypothesis.

In doing this, the researcher attempts to determine or predict what may occur. Experimental research is often used where there is time priority in a causal relationship (cause precedes effect), there is consistency in a causal relationship (a cause will always lead to the same effect), and the magnitude of the correlation is great. The classic experimental design specifies an experimental group and a control group. The independent variable is administered to the experimental group and not to the control group, and both groups are measured on the same dependent variable. Subsequent experimental designs have used more groups and more measurements over longer periods. True experiments must have control, randomization, and manipulation. What do these studies tell you ? Experimental research allows the researcher to control the situation. In so doing, it allows researchers to answer the question, \u201cWhat causes something to occur?\u201d Permits the researcher to identify cause and effect relationships between variables and to distinguish placebo effects from treatment effects. Experimental research designs support the ability to limit alternative explanations and to infer direct causal relationships in the study. Approach provides the highest level of evidence for single studies. What these studies don't tell you ? The design is artificial, and results may not generalize well to the real world. The artificial settings of experiments may alter the behaviors or responses of participants. Experimental designs can be costly if special equipment or facilities are needed.

The focus is on gaining insights and familiarity for later investigation or undertaken when research problems are in a preliminary stage of investigation. Exploratory designs are often used to establish an understanding of how best to proceed in studying an issue or what methodology would effectively apply to gathering information about the issue. The goals of exploratory research are intended to produce the following possible insights: Familiarity with basic details, settings, and concerns. Well grounded picture of the situation being developed. Generation of new ideas and assumptions. Development of tentative theories or hypotheses. Determination about whether a study is feasible in the future. Issues get refined for more systematic investigation and formulation of new research questions. Direction for future research and techniques get developed. What do these studies tell you ? Design is a useful approach for gaining background information on a particular topic. Exploratory research is flexible and can address research questions of all types (what, why, how). Provides an opportunity to define new terms and clarify existing concepts. Exploratory research is often used to generate formal hypotheses and develop more precise research problems. In the policy arena or applied to practice, exploratory studies help establish research priorities and where resources should be allocated. What these studies don't tell you ? Exploratory research generally utilizes small sample sizes and, thus, findings are typically not generalizable to the population at large. The exploratory nature of the research inhibits an ability to make definitive conclusions about the findings. They provide insight but not definitive conclusions. The research process underpinning exploratory studies is flexible but often unstructured, leading to only tentative results that have limited value to decision-makers. Design lacks rigorous standards applied to methods of data gathering and analysis because one of the areas for exploration could be to determine what method or methodologies could best fit the research problem.

Information acquired from observational research takes the form of \u201c field notes \u201d that involves documenting what the researcher actually sees and hears while in the field. Findings do not consist of conclusive statements derived from numbers and statistics because field research involves analysis of words and observations of behavior. Conclusions, therefore, are developed from an interpretation of findings that reveal overriding themes, concepts, and ideas. More information can be found HERE . What do these studies tell you ? Field research is often necessary to fill gaps in understanding the research problem applied to local conditions or to specific groups of people that cannot be ascertained from existing data. The research helps contextualize already known information about a research problem, thereby facilitating ways to assess the origins, scope, and scale of a problem and to gage the causes, consequences, and means to resolve an issue based on deliberate interaction with people in their natural inhabited spaces. Enables the researcher to corroborate or confirm data by gathering additional information that supports or refutes findings reported in prior studies of the topic. Because the researcher in embedded in the field, they are better able to make observations or ask questions that reflect the specific cultural context of the setting being investigated. Observing the local reality offers the opportunity to gain new perspectives or obtain unique data that challenges existing theoretical propositions or long-standing assumptions found in the literature. What these studies don't tell you A field research study requires extensive time and resources to carry out the multiple steps involved with preparing for the gathering of information, including for example, examining background information about the study site, obtaining permission to access the study site, and building trust and rapport with subjects. Requires a commitment to staying engaged in the field to ensure that you can adequately document events and behaviors as they unfold. The unpredictable nature of fieldwork means that researchers can never fully control the process of data gathering. They must maintain a flexible approach to studying the setting because events and circumstances can change quickly or unexpectedly. Findings can be difficult to interpret and verify without access to documents and other source materials that help to enhance the credibility of information obtained from the field [i.e., the act of triangulating the data]. Linking the research problem to the selection of study participants inhabiting their natural environment is critical. However, this specificity limits the ability to generalize findings to different situations or in other contexts or to infer courses of action applied to other settings or groups of people. The reporting of findings must take into account how the researcher themselves may have inadvertently affected respondents and their behaviors. Bailey, Carol R. and Carol A. Bailey.

            "box_content": "The function of a research design is to ensure that the evidence obtained enables you to effectively address the research problem logically and as unambiguously as possible . In social sciences research, obtaining information relevant to the research problem generally entails specifying the type of evidence needed to test the underlying assumptions of a theory, to evaluate a program, or to accurately describe and assess meaning related to an observable phenomenon. With this in mind, a common mistake made by researchers is that they begin their investigations before they have thought critically about what information is required to address the research problem. Without attending to these design issues beforehand, the overall research problem will not be adequately addressed and any conclusions drawn will run the risk of being weak and unconvincing. As a consequence, the overall validity of the study will be undermined. The length and complexity of describing the research design in your paper can vary considerably, but any well-developed description will achieve the following : Identify the research problem clearly and justify its selection, particularly in relation to any valid alternative designs that could have been used, Review and synthesize previously published literature associated with the research problem, Clearly and explicitly specify hypotheses [i.e., research questions] central to the problem, Effectively describe the information and/or data which will be necessary for an adequate testing of the hypotheses and explain how such information and/or data will be obtained, and Describe the methods of analysis to be applied to the data in determining whether or not the hypotheses are true or false. The research design is usually incorporated into the introduction of your paper . You can obtain an overall sense of what to do by reviewing studies that have utilized the same research design [e.g., using a case study approach]. This can help you develop an outline\u00a0to follow for your own paper.

The Research Methods Online database contains links to more than 175,000 pages of SAGE publisher's book, journal, and reference content on quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methodologies. Also included is a collection of case studies of social research projects that can be used to help you better understand abstract or complex methodological concepts.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose The purpose of a historical research design is to collect, verify, and synthesize evidence from the past to establish facts that defend or refute a hypothesis. It uses secondary sources and a variety of primary documentary evidence, such as, diaries, official records, reports, archives, and non-textual information [maps, pictures, audio and visual recordings]. The limitation is that the sources must be both authentic and valid. What do these studies tell you ? The historical research design is unobtrusive; the act of research does not affect the results of the study. The historical approach is well suited for trend analysis. Historical records can add important contextual background required to more fully understand and interpret a research problem. There is often no possibility of researcher-subject interaction that could affect the findings. Historical sources can be used over and over to study different research problems or to replicate a previous study. What these studies don't tell you ? The ability to fulfill the aims of your research are directly related to the amount and quality of documentation available to understand the research problem. Since historical research relies on data from the past, there is no way to manipulate it to control for contemporary contexts. Interpreting historical sources can be very time consuming. The sources of historical materials must be archived consistently to ensure access. This may especially challenging for digital or online-only sources. Original authors bring their own perspectives and biases to the interpretation of past events and these biases are more difficult to ascertain in historical resources. Due to the lack of control over external variables, historical research is very weak with regard to the demands of internal validity. It is rare that the entirety of historical documentation needed to fully address a research problem is available for interpretation, therefore, gaps need to be acknowledged.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose A longitudinal study follows the same sample over time and makes repeated observations. For example, with longitudinal surveys, the same group of people is interviewed at regular intervals, enabling researchers to track changes over time and to relate them to variables that might explain why the changes occur. Longitudinal research designs describe patterns of change and help establish the direction and magnitude of causal relationships. Measurements are taken on each variable over two or more distinct time periods. This allows the researcher to measure change in variables over time. It is a type of observational study sometimes referred to as a panel study. What do these studies tell you ? Longitudinal data facilitate the analysis of the duration of a particular phenomenon. Enables survey researchers to get close to the kinds of causal explanations usually attainable only with experiments. The design permits the measurement of differences or change in a variable from one period to another [i.e., the description of patterns of change over time]. Longitudinal studies facilitate the prediction of future outcomes based upon earlier factors. What these studies don't tell you ? The data collection method may change over time. Maintaining the integrity of the original sample can be difficult over an extended period of time. It can be difficult to show more than one variable at a time. This design often needs qualitative research data to explain fluctuations in the results. A longitudinal research design assumes present trends will continue unchanged. It can take a long period of time to gather results. There is a need to have a large sample size and accurate sampling to reach representativness. Anastas, Jeane W.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Meta-analysis is an analytical methodology designed to systematically evaluate and summarize the results from a number of individual studies, thereby, increasing the overall sample size and the ability of the researcher to study effects of interest. The purpose is to not simply summarize existing knowledge, but to develop a new understanding of a research problem using synoptic reasoning. The main objectives of meta-analysis include analyzing differences in the results among studies and increasing the precision by which effects are estimated. A well-designed meta-analysis depends upon strict adherence to the criteria used for selecting studies and the availability of information in each study to properly analyze their findings. Lack of information can severely limit the type of analyzes and conclusions that can be reached. In addition, the more dissimilarity there is in the results among individual studies [heterogeneity], the more difficult it is to justify interpretations that govern a valid synopsis of results. A meta-analysis needs to fulfill the following requirements to ensure the validity of your findings: Clearly defined description of objectives, including precise definitions of the variables and outcomes that are being evaluated; A well-reasoned and well-documented justification for identification and selection of the studies; Assessment and explicit acknowledgment of any researcher bias in the identification and selection of those studies; Description and evaluation of the degree of heterogeneity among the sample size of studies reviewed; and, Justification of the techniques used to evaluate the studies. What do these studies tell you ? Can be an effective strategy for determining gaps in the literature. Provides a means of reviewing research published about a particular topic over an extended period of time and from a variety of sources. Is useful in clarifying what policy or programmatic actions can be justified on the basis of analyzing research results from multiple studies. Provides a method for overcoming small sample sizes in individual studies that previously may have had little relationship to each other. Can be used to generate new hypotheses or highlight research problems for future studies. What these studies don't tell you ? Small violations in defining the criteria used for content analysis can lead to difficult to interpret and/or meaningless findings. A large sample size can yield reliable, but not necessarily valid, results. A lack of uniformity regarding, for example, the type of literature reviewed, how methods are applied, and how findings are measured within the sample of studies you are analyzing, can make the process of synthesis difficult to perform. Depending on the sample size, the process of reviewing and synthesizing multiple studies can be very time consuming.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Mixed methods research represents more of an approach to examining a research problem than a methodology. Mixed method is characterized by a focus on research problems that require, 1) an examination of real-life contextual understandings, multi-level perspectives, and cultural influences; 2) an intentional application of rigorous quantitative research assessing magnitude and frequency of constructs and rigorous qualitative research exploring the meaning and understanding of the constructs; and, 3) an objective of drawing on the strengths of quantitative and qualitative data gathering techniques to formulate a holistic interpretive framework for generating possible solutions or new understandings of the problem. Tashakkori and Creswell (2007) and other proponents of mixed methods argue that the design encompasses more than simply combining qualitative and quantitative methods but, rather, reflects a new \"third way\" epistemological paradigm that occupies the conceptual space between positivism and interpretivism. What do these studies tell you ? Narrative and non-textual information can add meaning to numeric data, while numeric data can add precision to narrative and non-textual information. Can utilize existing data while at the same time generating and testing a grounded theory approach to describe and explain the phenomenon under study. A broader, more complex research problem can be investigated because the researcher is not constrained by using only one method. The strengths of one method can be used to overcome the inherent weaknesses of another method. Can provide stronger, more robust evidence to support a conclusion or set of recommendations. May generate new knowledge new insights or uncover hidden insights, patterns, or relationships that a single methodological approach might not reveal. Produces more complete knowledge and understanding of the research problem that can be used to increase the generalizability of findings applied to theory or practice. What these studies don't tell you ? A researcher must be proficient in understanding how to apply multiple methods to investigating a research problem as well as be proficient in optimizing how to design a study that coherently melds them together. Can increase the likelihood of conflicting results or ambiguous findings that inhibit drawing a valid conclusion or setting forth a recommended course of action [e.g., sample interview responses do not support existing statistical data]. Because the research design can be very complex, reporting the findings requires a well-organized narrative, clear writing style, and precise word choice. Design invites collaboration among experts. However, merging different investigative approaches and writing styles requires more attention to the overall research process than studies conducted using only one methodological paradigm. Concurrent merging of quantitative and qualitative research requires greater attention to having adequate sample sizes, using comparable samples, and applying a consistent unit of analysis. For sequential designs where one phase of qualitative research builds on the quantitative phase or vice versa, decisions about what results from the first phase to use in the next phase, the choice of samples and estimating reasonable sample sizes for both phases, and the interpretation of results from both phases can be difficult. Due to multiple forms of data being collected and analyzed, this design requires extensive time and resources to carry out the multiple steps involved in data gathering and interpretation.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose This type of research design draws a conclusion by comparing subjects against a control group, in cases where the researcher has no control over the experiment. There are two general types of observational designs. In direct observations, people know that you are watching them. Unobtrusive measures involve any method for studying behavior where individuals do not know they are being observed. An observational study allows a useful insight into a phenomenon and avoids the ethical and practical difficulties of setting up a large and cumbersome research project. What do these studies tell you ? Observational studies are usually flexible and do not necessarily need to be structured around a hypothesis about what you expect to observe [data is emergent rather than pre-existing]. The researcher is able to collect in-depth information about a particular behavior. Can reveal interrelationships among multifaceted dimensions of group interactions. You can generalize your results to real life situations. Observational research is useful for discovering what variables may be important before applying other methods like experiments. Observation research designs account for the complexity of group behaviors. What these studies don't tell you ? Reliability of data is low because seeing behaviors occur over and over again may be a time consuming task and are difficult to replicate. In observational research, findings may only reflect a unique sample population and, thus, cannot be generalized to other groups. There can be problems with bias as the researcher may only \"see what they want to see.\" There is no possibility to determine \"cause and effect\" relationships since nothing is manipulated. Sources or subjects may not all be equally credible. Any group that is knowingly studied is altered to some degree by the presence of the researcher, therefore, potentially skewing any data collected.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Understood more as an broad approach to examining a research problem than a methodological design, philosophical analysis and argumentation is intended to challenge deeply embedded, often intractable, assumptions underpinning an area of study. This approach uses the tools of argumentation derived from philosophical traditions, concepts, models, and theories to critically explore and challenge, for example, the relevance of logic and evidence in academic debates, to analyze arguments about fundamental issues, or to discuss the root of existing discourse about a research problem. These overarching tools of analysis can be framed in three ways: Ontology -- the study that describes the nature of reality; for example, what is real and what is not, what is fundamental and what is derivative? Epistemology -- the study that explores the nature of knowledge; for example, by what means does knowledge and understanding depend upon and how can we be certain of what we know? Axiology -- the study of values; for example, what values does an individual or group hold and why? How are values related to interest, desire, will, experience, and means-to-end? And, what is the difference between a matter of fact and a matter of value? What do these studies tell you ? Can provide a basis for applying ethical decision-making to practice. Functions as a means of gaining greater self-understanding and self-knowledge about the purposes of research. Brings clarity to general guiding practices and principles of an individual or group. Philosophy informs methodology. Refine concepts and theories that are invoked in relatively unreflective modes of thought and discourse. Beyond methodology, philosophy also informs critical thinking about epistemology and the structure of reality (metaphysics). Offers clarity and definition to the practical and theoretical uses of terms, concepts, and ideas. What these studies don't tell you ? Limited application to specific research problems [answering the \"So What?\" question in social science research]. Analysis can be abstract, argumentative, and limited in its practical application to real-life issues. While a philosophical analysis may render problematic that which was once simple or taken-for-granted, the writing can be dense and subject to unnecessary jargon, overstatement, and/or excessive quotation and documentation. There are limitations in the use of metaphor as a vehicle of philosophical analysis. There can be analytical difficulties in moving from philosophy to advocacy and between abstract thought and application to the phenomenal world.

            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose Sequential research is that which is carried out in a deliberate, staged approach [i.e. serially] where one stage will be completed, followed by another, then another, and so on, with the aim that each stage will build upon the previous one until enough data is gathered over an interval of time to test your hypothesis. The sample size is not predetermined. After each sample is analyzed, the researcher can accept the null hypothesis, accept the alternative hypothesis, or select another pool of subjects and conduct the study once again. This means the researcher can obtain a limitless number of subjects before making a final decision whether to accept the null or alternative hypothesis. Using a quantitative framework, a sequential study generally utilizes sampling techniques to gather data and applying statistical methods to analze the data. Using a qualitative framework, sequential studies generally utilize samples of individuals or groups of individuals [cohorts] and use qualitative methods, such as interviews or observations, to gather information from each sample. What do these studies tell you ? The researcher has a limitless option when it comes to sample size and the sampling schedule. Due to the repetitive nature of this research design, minor changes and adjustments can be done during the initial parts of the study to correct and hone the research method. This is a useful design for exploratory studies. There is very little effort on the part of the researcher when performing this technique. It is generally not expensive, time consuming, or workforce intensive. Because the study is conducted serially, the results of one sample are known before the next sample is taken and analyzed. This provides opportunities for continuous improvement of sampling and methods of analysis. What these studies don't tell you ? The sampling method is not representative of the entire population. The only possibility of approaching representativeness is when the researcher chooses to use a very large sample size significant enough to represent a significant portion of the entire population. In this case, moving on to study a second or more specific sample can be difficult. The design cannot be used to create conclusions and interpretations that pertain to an entire population because the sampling technique is not randomized. Generalizability from findings is, therefore, limited. Difficult to account for and interpret variation from one sample to another over time, particularly when using qualitative methods of data collection. Betensky, Rebecca.

            "box_title": "Systematic Review",
            "box_content": "Definition and Purpose As noted by Denyer and Tranfield [2009], a systematic review is a specific methodology that identifies existing research about a well-defined topic of investigation, usually derived from a public policy or clinical, practice-based problem. The design involves selecting and critically evaluating the contributions of each identified study, analyzing and carefully synthesizing the data, and reporting the evidence in a way that facilitates clear conclusions about what is and is not known. A systematic review is not a traditional literature review, but a self-contained research project that explores a clearly defined research problem using existing studies. The design of a systematic review differs from other review methods because distinct and exacting principles are applied to the evaluative process of analyzing existing literature. NOTE : A thorough and well-designed systematic review requires extensive and on-going consultation with a librarian to ensure that all published and unpublished studies concerning the research problem have been located and evaluated as to whether they should be included in your analysis. Due to the required time commitment and workload, these types of reviews are often conducted as a group project. What do these studies tell you ? A systematic review synthesizes the findings of multiple studies related to each other by incorporating strategies of analysis and interpretation intended to reduce biases and random errors. The application of critical exploration, evaluation, and synthesis methods separates insignificant, unsound, or redundant research from the most salient and relevant studies worthy of reflection. They can be use to identify, justify, and refine hypotheses, recognize and avoid hidden problems in prior studies, and explain data inconsistencies and conflicts in data. Systematic reviews can be used to help policy makers formulate evidence-based guidelines and regulations. The use of strict, explicit, and pre-determined methods of synthesis, when applied appropriately, provide reliable estimates about the effects of interventions, evaluations, and effects related to the overarching research problem investigated by each study under review. Systematic reviews illuminate where knowledge or thorough understanding of a research problem is lacking and, therefore, can then be used to guide future research. The accepted inclusion of unpublished studies [i.e., grey literature] ensures the broadest possible way to analyze and interpret research on a topic. Results of the synthesis can be generalized and the findings extrapolated into the general population with more validity than most other types of studies . What these studies don't tell you ? Systematic reviews do not create new knowledge per se; they are a method for synthesizing existing studies about a research problem in order to gain new insights and determine gaps in the literature. The way researchers have carried out their investigations [e.g., the period of time covered, number of participants, sources of data analyzed, etc.] can make it difficult to effectively synthesize studies. The inclusion of unpublished studies can introduce bias into the review because they may not have undergone a rigorous peer-review process prior to publication. Examples may include conference presentations or proceedings, publications from government agencies, white papers, working papers, and internal documents from organizations, and doctoral dissertations and Master's theses.

Also a line drawing, made to accompany and illustrate a geometrical theorem, mathematical demonstration, etc. Drawing -- a graphic illustration of representing a person, place, or object or a technique for outlining the geometry, layout, location, and design of a figure, plan, or sketch by means of lines. Figure -- a form bounded by three or more lines; one or more digits or numerical symbols representing a number. Flowchart -- a pictorial summary\u00a0 [graphical algorithm] of the decisions and flows [movement\u00a0 of information] that make up a procedure or process\u00a0 from beginning to end. Also called flow diagram, flow process chart, or network diagram. Form -- a logically structured document with a fixed arrangement of captioned spaces designed for entering, extracting, or communicating required or requested information. Graph -- a two-dimensional drawing\u00a0 showing a relationship [usually between two set of numbers] by means\u00a0 of a line, curve, a series\u00a0 of bars, or other symbols. Typically, an independent variable is represented on the horizontal line (X-axis) and an dependent variable on the vertical line (Y-axis). The perpendicular axis intersect at a point called origin, and are calibrated in the units of the quantities\u00a0 represented. Though a graph usually has four quadrants representing the positive and negative values\u00a0 of the variables, usually only the north-east quadrant is shown when the negative values do not exist or are of no interest. Often used interchangeably with the term \u201cchart.\u201d Histogram -- step-column chart that displays a summary of the variations in (frequency distribution of) quantities [called Classes] that fall within certain lower and upper limits\u00a0 in a set of data. Classes are measured on the horizontal ('X') axis, and the number of times they occur [or the percentages\u00a0 of their occurrences] are measured on the vertical ('Y') axis. To construct a histogram, rectangles or blocks are drawn on the x-axis [without any spaces between them] whose areas are proportional to the classes they represent. Histograms [and histographs] are used commonly where the subject\u00a0 item is discrete (such as the number of students in a school) instead of being continuous [such as the variations in their heights]. Also called frequency diagram, a histogram is usually preferred over a histograph where the number of classes is less than eight. Illustration -- a visual representation [e.g., picture or diagram] that is used to make a subject in a paper more pleasing or easier to understand. Map -- a visual representation of an area. It is considered to be a symbolic depiction highlighting relationships between elements of that space such as objects, regions, and themes. Examples of types include climate, economic, resource, physical, political, road, and topographic maps. Pictograph -- visual presentation of data using icons, pictures, symbols, etc., in place of or in addition to common graph elements [bars, lines, points]. Pictographs use relative sizes or repetitions of the same icon, picture, or symbol to show comparison. Also called a pictogram, pictorial chart, pictorial graph, or picture graph. Symbol -- Mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Table -- an orderly arrangement\u00a0 of quantitative data in columns and rows. Also called a \u201cmatrix.\u201d BusinessDictionary.com.

            "box_content": "There are a variety of reasons for including non-textual elements in your paper. Among them are: A picture is worth a thousand words . Embedding a chart, illustration, table, graph, map, photograph, or other non-textual element into your research paper can bring added clarity to a study because it provides a clean, concise way to report findings that would otherwise take several long [and boring] paragraphs to describe. Non-textual elements are useful tools for summarizing information , especially when you have a great deal of data to present. Non-textual elements help the reader grasp a large amount of data quickly and in an orderly fashion. Non-textual elements help you highlight important pieces of information without breaking up the narrative flow of your paper. Illustrations, photographs, maps, and the like can be used as a quick reference to information that helps to highlight key issues found in the text. For example, a street map showing the distribution of health care facilities can be included in a larger study documenting the struggles of poor families to find adequate health care. Non-textual elements are visually engaging. Using a chart or photograph, for example, can help enhance the overall presentation of your research and provide a way to stimulate a reader's interest in the study. Easily compare and contrast findings . Non-textual elements, such as a bar chart or table of statistics, offer a quick way to compare values and track trends or create figures that show side-by-side comparisons of information as an easy way to contrast the data.

            "box_title": "Structure and Writing Style",
            "box_content": "Use non-textual elements, such as figures, tables, graphs, maps, photographs, etc., to support your key findings . Readers should be able to discern the meaning of non-textual elements on their own without having to refer to the text to understand the data being presented. Reference to a non-textual element in the text of your paper should focus on describing its significance in relation to the research problem or the topic being discussed. In the social sciences, non-textual elements must have neat, legible titles, be simple, and have detailed captions that are written in complete sentences; they should fully explain the item without forcing the reader to refer to the text. Conversely, the reader should not have to refer back and forth from the text to the non-textual elements to understand the paper. General rules about using non-textual elements in your research paper: Each non-textual element must have a short, descriptive title, numbered consecutively and complete with a heading [e.g., Table 1. National Sales Activity from 2009-2014]. Conform to the rules set forth within the writing style you are using for the paper regarding the use of non-textual elements [e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago] and use it consistently throughout your paper. Either place figures, tables, charts, etc. within the text of the result being described, or refer to them in an appendix--do one or the other but never both. You should explicitly reference the number of the figures, tables, graphs, etc. in the text [i.e., \"Table 6 shows...\"]. Avoid expressions like, \"in the chart on the following page\" or \"in the table below.\" If you choose to place non-textual elements within the paper, they should be positioned as close as possible to where it is first mentioned in the text. If you place non-textual elements in an appendix, make sure they are clearly distinguished from any raw data. Each non-textual element must be interpreted and its relevance and significance explained in relation to the research problem. All non-textual elements should have a consistent look about them. This can be achieved by the following do's and don'ts do use a box or frame to surround the element. do not use a different text font to that used in the body of the work [e.g., Ariel vs. New Times Roman]. do use small caps when formatting headings. do not use fancy or cursive fonts. do change the page layout from portrait to landscape if this helps you display the non-textual element more effectively; always place the \"top\" of the page along the left-hand margin and maintain page numbering. If the non-textual element within the text is not adapted from another source and totally your own creation, take credit for your work and say so! Otherwise, you must cite where you found the data. You must also cite the source even if you reorganize or rearrange the data [e.g., \"Chart 4 is adapted from...\"]. You may refer to non-textual elements by using parentheses with or without the verb \u201csee\u201d (i.e., \"see Table 1\"). However, it is important to be consistent with whichever choice you make. References to non-textual elements within the text of your paper are generally put in parentheses , e.g. \"...the number of schools have grown (see Figure 1)\" or \"...although the distribution of savings among city employees has been reduced during the last decade (Chart 2)\" because this information is generally supplementary to the results themselves; most of the text should focus on highlighting key findings. NOTE: Do not overuse non-textual elements! Include them sparingly and only in cases where they are an effective means for enhancing and/or supplementing information already described in your paper. Using too many non-textual elements disrupts the narrative flow of your paper, making it more difficult for the reader to synthesize and interpret your overall research. If you have to use a lot of non-textual elements, consider organizing them in an appendix . and refer to them in the text, such as, \"data shown in Appendix One shows....\" ANOTHER NOTE: Excel and other computer programs are capable of creating very elaborate, colorful, and dramatic looking non-textual elements. However, be careful not to let aesthetics and artistry overwhelm the message you are trying to convey to the reader. Use these features only to help improve the reader's understanding of the information being presented. For example, if a pie chart is being used to show the distribution of responses to a survey, use distinctive colors to distinguish between each part of the chart.

            "box_title": "Writing Concisely",
            "box_content": "Academic writing in the social sciences often examines abstruse topics that require in-depth analysis and explanation. As a result, a common challenge to writing college-level research papers is expressing your thoughts clearly by utilizing language that communicates essential information unambiguously. When you proofread your paper, critically review your writing style and the terminology you used throughout your paper. Pay particular attention to identifying and editing the following categories of imprecise writing. Problems with Wordiness \u2013 the use of more words than is necessary to communicate a thought, concept, or idea. Cliches \u2013 these are phrases that have become bland and ordinary through overuse. Besides indicating lazy thinking because they are often used as a substitute for carefully considering what to say, cliches should not be used due to the fact that they're often embedded within a specific cultural context. For example, if you say, \"The Iraqi diplomat is going out on a limb if he does not protect his country's economic interests during negotiations with the United States.\" Americans may understand what it means to be \u201cgoing out on a limb\u201d [this reflects the act of being vulnerable derived from the sport of hunting\u2013get it?], but would someone from another culture know what this means? Intensifiers \u2013 these include modifying words, such as, very, literally, radically, definitely, significantly, greatly, extremely, moderately, basically, exceptionally, obviously, really, uncommonly, etc. Intensifiers create the illusion of accentuating words but, in academic writing, intensifiers actually have the opposite effect because they do not covey anything measurable. And editing intensifiers does not imply exchanging the term \u201cextremely large\u201d with the word \u201chuge\u201d; if something is unusual or it needs highlighting, quantify its uniqueness and place it in a comparative context [e.g., instead of saying, \u201c...an extremely large increase in hospital visitations,\u201d state as, \u201c...a 45% increase in hospital visitations since 2010\u201d]. If there is no data to quantify the phenomena, then describe its significance using precise language [e.g., \"Evidence that hospital visitations are increasing may impact the quality of patient services because there are no indications that staffing levels will be increased in the foreseeable future\"] . Nominalizations \u2013 this refers to a verb, adjective, or adverb that has been converted into a noun or noun phrase. Although this practice is not grammatically incorrect, overuse of nominalizations can clutter your writing. Examples include: \"take action,\" \"draw conclusions,\" and \"make assumptions.\" These phrases can be reduced to: \"act,\" \"conclude,\" and \"assume.\" Other nominalizations take the form of adding derivational suffixes to a verb, such as, --ance (deliver to deliverance) or -ize (modern to modernize). Editing the action of the sentence back into a bare infinitive verb [the most basic form of a verb] will undo the nominalization, making the sentence more succinct and easier to read. Stock phrases \u2013 this refers to phrases that compromise clarity in your writing by adding unnecessary complexity to the sentence; stock phrases are similar to cliches in that they are overused terms. Examples include: \u201chas the ability to,\u201d \u201cdue to the fact that,\u201d \u201cregardless of the fact,\u201d or \u201cat this point in time.\u201d Stock phrases often can and should be reduced to one word. Therefore, the above phrases can be reduced to \u201ccan,\u201d \u201cbecause,\u201d although,\u201d and \u201cnow.\u201d Verbal phrases \u2013 these are also phrases that contribute little or no meaning to the overall sentence. They are similar to stock phrases but can be reduced to a single action verb. Examples include: \u201cto come to a conclusion,\u201d \"to take into consideration,\" or \u201cto make a determination.\u201d The above phrases can be reduced to \u201cconclude,\u201d \"consider,\" or \u201cdetermine.\" Problems with Redundancy \u2013 the use of words or phrases that possess the same or almost the same meaning. Implied modifiers (similar meaning) \u2013 implied modifiers can refer to the meaning of a word or phrase possessing the same or very similar meaning of the modifier. These types of modifying words can be subtle and difficult to locate but eliminating them will help clarify your writing. There are two ways to edit these modifiers. For example, if you say, \u201cThe next decision of the Supreme Court is difficult to anticipate in advance.\u201d Think about the implied meaning of \"anticipate in advance\"; if something is expected to happen in advance, it is inherently going to be next and be anticipatory. Restate the sentence using only one of those words [e.g., \" The next decision of the Supreme Court is difficult to anticipate\" or \"It will be difficult to anticipate the next decision of the Supreme Court\"]. Implied modifiers (incomplete thought) \u2013 implied modifiers can also suggest an incomplete thought about the subject of the sentence. Consider the following statement: \u201cThe maritime negotiations between Japan and China remain a difficult challenge.\u201d It can be implied that any type of challenge is difficult. However, by inserting an explanation [\u201cbecause\u201d] within the sentence, you expand the thought more completely. Therefore, you can either say, \u201cThe maritime negotiations between Japan and China remain a challenge because it is difficult to...,\u201d or you can say, \u201cThe maritime negotiations between Japan and China remain difficult because the main challenge is....\u201d NOTE : This form of implied modifiers demonstrates that the act of writing concisely isn't simply about reducing the number of words you use; it is also an act of effectively expressing specifically what you mean to say. Paired synonyms \u2013 words paired together that have the same basic meaning may sound appealing when read aloud but they are unnecessary. Examples include: each and every, peace and quiet, first and foremost, alter or change, true and accurate, true and correct, always and forever. Choose only one word from the pairing that reflects the meaning you are trying to convey or use a thesaurus to find a word that more accurately reflects your thoughts. Other word pairings are over-used catch phrases, such as, \u201cfirst and foremost,\u201d \"end result,\" \"various differences,\" \"sudden crisis,\" or \u201ccompletely eliminate.\u201d They are redundant and re-state the obvious; choose only one word or eliminate them altogether. Problems with Unclear Sentence Constructions -- short, declarative sentences are easier to comprehend than lengthy narratives. Active voice \u2013 some professors, particularly in business, technical, or scientific writing courses, may prefer that you write papers using a passive voice because they want you to convey information objectivity by using an authoritative tone that focuses on the main idea or recommended action rather than the conscious intent underlying the idea or action. However, the passive voice frequently requires more words than is necessary to covey a thought or idea. Unless instructed not to do so, write using an active voice. Here is an example: Passive\u2013\"It is believed by the state legislature that a person\u2019s picture on their drivers license must be updated every five years\" [21 words]. In the active voice, the sentence would read: \"The state legislature believes that a drivers license picture must be updated every five years\" [15 words]. Note here as well the phrase, \u201ca person\u2019s drivers license\u201d; who else would own a drivers license but a person? The word \u201cperson\u2019s\u201d is redundant and can also be deleted. Combining sentences \u2013 it is often true that writing shorter, declarative sentences helps the reader better understand the content and meaning of each thought or idea. However, it is also the case that two or more sentences may be combined to convey the information more effectively using fewer words. Review your paper and look for paragraphs that appear wordy. This may indicate opportunities to condense sentences. Here is an example: \u201cThe BP oil spill occurred in 2010. This oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico prompted greater attention to regulating offshore drilling. Among these regulations was a rule governing procedures for capping wells.\u201d These three sentences can be combined to read: \u201cThe 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico prompted greater attention to regulatory procedures for capping offshore drilling wells.\u201d All of the essential information remains, but it is stated more concisely.

The Visual History Archive has over 1,350 interviews with people hailing either from what was once eastern Poland \u2014 cities such as Baranavichy, Hrodna, Navahrudak, Brest, Lida, Slonim, and Pinsk \u2014or from the prewar Soviet Belorussian Republic\u2014from Minsk , Mahiliou, Babruisk, Homel', Vitsebsk among other locations. The interviews give information on 91 ghettos and 27 camps in \"Polish\" Belarus and 69 ghettos and 22 camps in \"Soviet\" Belarus . There is a particularly strong collection of interviews with survivors from the Minsk ghetto, who managed to escape from the ghetto and join the partisans; these include interviewees with the leaders of the Minsk ghetto resistance or their family members. The archive also provide historical insight into less well known places, such as the relatively obscure ghetto in Kolyshki from which survivors were able to escape to safety in March 1942, having learned that the Soviet frontline was momentarily nearby. On account of its forests and swamps, Belarus was the center of Soviet partisan activity, and the testimonies reflect this prominently. Many interviewees fought in Jewish partisan units such as the Bielski partisans or the Zorin detachment or with the numerous Soviet units operational there. A noteworthy group of testimonies are those given by people who assisted Jews in escaping and hiding, often for extended periods. Most aid recipients kept close relations with their rescuers after the war. Twelve rescuers were interviewed in Belarus . A total of 246 interviews were conducted in Belarus , all in Russian.

            "box_content": "The USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive contains a wealth of material on the little known Holocaust history of Bulgaria. Between 1996 and 1998, the USC Shoah Foundation conducted 628 interviews in Bulgaria\u2014in the capital city Sofia, as well as in Plovdiv, Varna, and 18 other locations. The interviewees comprise 623 Jewish survivors and five Roma survivors. 624 of the interviews were conducted in the Bulgarian language and 4 in Russian. Within the entire archive, 671 interviewees were born in Bulgaria and at least 814 interviewees talk about their experiences in Bulgaria before, during, and after the war. As an Axis power allied with Nazi Germany, Bulgaria conducted a number of measures against its Jewish population during World War II. Alexander Belev, leader of the anti-Semitic group Ratnitsi Napreduka na Bulgarshtinata, implemented these measures as head of the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs (discussed in 21 testimonies). From 1941, Jewish men were conscripted into forced labor groups (described in 251 testimonies). Labor camps were established at Somovit, Pleven-Kailuka, and other locations. In 1943, a \u201cresettlement\u201d program was introduced whereby Jews were forced to leave the major cities and move to smaller towns (referred to in 292 testimonies). Opposition to deportations and the policy toward Jews was led by Dimitur Peshev, the vice president of parliament (mentioned in 11 testimonies). As a result of these efforts, the Bulgarian Jewish community was not transported out of the country and largely survived the war. The monarch, King Boris III, whose wartime role is the subject of debate, is also discussed in 78 testimonies. During World War II Bulgaria annexed parts of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Romania, and it was from these regions\u2014Macedonia and Thrace, in particular\u2014that Bulgarian authorities transported Jews ultimately to extermination camps in Poland. The collection includes a handful of survivors from these areas who successfully evaded deportation and fled across the border to Albania or Greece.

Most victims perished through murder, starvation, torture, medical experiments, untreated diseases, forced marches, and exhaustion from forced labor. However, even after 1979, the Khmer Rouge remained active in remote regions of the country; thus, fatalities may be higher than documented. In January 2017, the USC Shoah Foundation added to the VHA five testimonies of survivors of the Cambodian Genocide. The testimonies were recorded by the USC Shoah Foundation in the United States in 2009, 2011, and 2015. Three are in English and two in Khmer (with English subtitles).

            "box_content": "What is today the Czech Republic was, before 1938, part of Czechoslovakia - specifically the provinces Bohemia and Moravia & Silesia (including the Sudetenland region). The majority of the testimonies from here relate to the major cities, particularly the capital Prague . Czech Jews were first subject to the malevolence of Nazi rule even before the outbreak of World War II. After\u00a0 March 1939 invasion by Germany , laws restricting Jews that were already in force increased in their severity and attacks on and seizures of Jewish property became commonplace. Deportations soon began. As early as October 1939, an experimental deportation plan moved a group of Moravian Jews to an area of Poland (the so-called \"Nisko and Lublin plan\"); four survivors in the archive recount their experiences of this. In 1941, others were deported to the ghettos in the east: 30 survivors interviewed in the archive were deported from Czechoslovakia to the L\u00f3dz ghetto, eight were sent (via Theresienstadt) to the Riga ghetto, two to the Minsk ghetto. Some managed to avoid deportation at least temporarily, while a number managed to emigrate before that option was curtailed in October 1941. Beginning in 1942, most remaining Jews were sent to the Theresienstadt \"model ghetto\" (discussed by 2,193 interviewees in total, 704 of whom were born in Czechoslovakia ). From Theresienstadt, most Czech Jews were moved to Auschwitz . The archive also contains references to numerous labor camps established by the Nazis in Bohemia , Sudetenland, and Silesia , as well as camps set up in Moravia specifically for Hungarian Jews after 1944. A few testimonies in Czech refer to the Panensk\u00e9 Brezany (Jungfern Breschan) camp, the private camp of Frau Heydrich, wife of Reinhard Heydrich (the SS chief and \"Protector\" of Bohemia and Moravia ). A small number of Jews in mixed marriages avoided deportation until early 1945. Others discuss the mixed-marriage camps such as Prague Hagibor and L\u00edpa (B\u00f6hmisch-Leipa). After liberation in 1945, Prague became a focal point for refugees. Of those who survived, many Czech Jews chose to emigrate. Nevertheless, around half of the 999 interviews with people born in the Czech lands were conducted in the Czech Republic . Those who did remain recount their experiences under Communist rule, including reminiscences of the Prague Spring of 1968. The testimony of Hanus M\u00fcnz (interview code 6804, Czech) is an extremely rare example of a Czech survivor of Malyi Trostenets. Richard Glazar (interview code 8552, German) is one of only two survivors from the Czech lands of the Treblinka II death camp. Kurt Thomas (interview code 28104, English), who also gave an interview to the Shoah Foundation, is a Czech survivor of the Sobib\u00f3r death camp. The testimony of Viktor Las (interview code 6809, Czech) is remarkable for his description of performing cleanup work after the notorious German massacre of the village of Lidice . The USC Shoah Foundation conducted 567 interviews in the Czech Republic and 566 in the Czech language. Around 1,000 of the archive's interviewees were born in what is today the Czech Republic.

In the context of the Holocaust, Czechoslovakia has a diverse and regionally specific history, and each area is well represented in the interviews of the Visual History Archive. Over 5,300 interviewees were born here: around 1,000 in the Czech lands; 1,900 in Slovakia , and 2,400 in Podkarpatsk\u00e1 Rus. More than 10,600 witnesses discuss their experiences in Czechoslovakia before, during, and after the war. The USC Shoah Foundation conducted 567 interviews in the Czech Republic , 664 in Slovakia , and around 90 in Subcarpathian Ukraine . The collection includes 566 interviews in the Czech language and 573 in Slovak. The territorial ambitions of Nazi Germany had a decisive impact on Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II. The country was partitioned into three distinct parts as a result of German involvement, either directly or indirectly. In October 1938, Nazi troops occupied the Sudetenland (the annexation is described at length in 77 testimonies); in March of the following year, Hitler proclaimed the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (220 testimonies). Also that March, Slovakia declared independence, becoming a puppet state of Nazi Germany. The separation was complete when in November 1938 and March 1939, Hungary annexed the whole of Podkarpatsk\u00e1 Rus province and a strip of southern Slovakia (described specifically in 668 testimonies). Many fled. Some of those who reached the United Kingdom , where the government-in-exile was established, went on to fight in Czechoslovak units of the British Army; others who went east enlisted with the Czechoslovak division set up in the Soviet Army in 1941. These units are discussed in 161 testimonies. For testimonies about the Czech Lands and Sudetenland, see the entry for Czech Republic . For testimonies about Slovakia, see the entry for Slovakia .

            "box_content": "The French collection is one of the largest in the Visual History Archive. Interviewees talk about France in over 7,600 testimonies, including 4,618 during the World War II period. Their interviews were conducted in various languages - including 1,949 interviews in French - and in several different locations - 1,675 in France. Close to 1,400 interviewees were born in France. There was a large Jewish community in France before the war, and a number of testimonies describe specific communities in locations around France. The French testimonies describe how, after Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, refugees began arriving in France in ever greater numbers, especially after war broke out. After the French capitulation to the Germans in June 1940, many fled to the unoccupied zone in the centre and south of the country. Interviews give details of the numerous internment camps established around France, as well as in French territories such as Algeria. Near Paris, the Drancy camp became the main transit point for Jews being deported east to Auschwitz. The actions of the French police and the Milice are discussed. A large number of testimonies have descriptions of hiding and assuming a false identity. Interviewees talk about how they were helped by, or were involved in, organizations such as the OSE (Oeuvre de Secours Aux Enfants) which were able to place children in convents, monasteries, and orphanages in rural locations (such as the Ch\u00e2teau-de-Chabannes and others), and subsequently to assist people fleeing across the border to Switzerland. Many discuss the role of the UGIF (Union g\u00e9n\u00e9rale Isra\u00e9lites de France), the official body for all Jewish affairs in France established by the Vichy government in 1941, and that of the \u00c9claireurs Isra\u00e9lites de France (Jewish scouting movement). Those who fled to the zone under Italian control in the south of France generally report much safer conditions, although this changed drastically once the Germans occupied the area after September 1943. A major topic of the French testimonies is the Maquis (the resistance movement). Many survivors were actively involved in groups such as the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, French Forces of the Interior, and others. The testimonies give information on figures such as L\u00e9on Blum, the prime minister of France from 1936 to 1937; Varian Fry, the American rescue worker European director of the Emergency Rescue Committee; Robert Gamzon, founder of the Eclaireurs Isra\u00e9lites de France and of the resistance group known as La Sixi\u00e8me (The Sixth); Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain; Klaus Barbie (the Gestapo chief known as the \"Butcher of Lyon\"); Maurice Papon, civil servant in the Vichy administration in southern France; Paul Touvier, head of the local branch of the Milice in Lyon and later found guilty of \"crimes against humanity\"; among many others. A number of testimonies talk about Serge Klarsfeld, survivor and anti-Nazi activist. In addition, the archive contains the testimony of Klarsfeld, as well as that of his wife and son.

Among these are over 6 ,100 interviews with people who were born in pre-World War II Germany, 924 German-language interviews, and 672 interviews that were conducted in Germany. A large group of testimonies describe Germany after Hitler\u2019s ascent to power in 1933. They detail the anti-Jewish measures and legislation, including the Nuremberg Laws; the early concentration camps such as Dachau and Oranienberg; the experience of Jewish World War I veterans; organizations such as Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden, Kulturbund deutscher Juden, and Bund Deutsch-j\u00fcdischer Jugend; the deportation of Polish-born Jews in 1938; and the November Pogrom of 1938 (also known as \u201cKristallnacht\u201d). They thoroughly document the exodus of much of the German-Jewish population through emigration to the USA, the UK (Kindertransports), Shanghai, and other locations. The wartime period of Nazi Germany is described in a number of interviews. They relate how some Jews were able to survive by hiding or concealing their identity in cities such as Berlin. Other testimonies discuss the experiences of \u201cMischlinge\u201d (or \u201cmixed Jews\u201d - \u201chalf-Jews\u201d and \u201cquarter-Jews\u201d), the role of the Berlin Jewish Hospital as an assembly point for Jews being deported as well as a temporary sanctuary for those who were \u201cprotected\u201d, the Fabrik-Aktion and the Rosenstrasse Protest. A small number of testimonies refer to Die Weisse Rose (White Rose), as well as other German anti-Nazi resistance groups (Rote K\u00e4mpfer, Gemeinschaft f\u00fcr Frieden und Aufbau, Chug Chaluzi, Gruppe Baum, Internationales Lagerkomittee Buchenwald). The experience of German Jews who were deported to ghettos in the East is also covered. The archive includes 44 interviewees born in Germany who survived the Lodz ghetto, 144 born in Germany and survived the Riga ghetto, 17 born in Germany and survived the Kaunas (Kovno) ghetto, and 7 who were born in Germany and survived the Minsk ghetto. The Visual History Archive reflects that massive numbers of prisoners from all over Europe who experienced concentration camps in Germany such as Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, Dachau, and Ravensbr\u00fcck, and labor camps in and around Berlin, Hamburg, and other cities. All of these and many others are discussed in multiple testimonies. The archive contains 827 German-language interviews with Jewish Holocaust survivors, 41 interviews with political prisoners, 15 Sinti and Roma survivors, 13 German-language interviews with Eugenics-policies survivors, 10 rescuers and aid providers, 9 with war crimes trial participants, and 3 German-language interviews with homosexual survivors. All 13 of the interviews with Eugenics-policies survivors are in German. Among the German interviews are those of Mietek Pemper, Amon Goeth\u2019s secretary for some time in the Plaszow concentration camp; Ernest Rosin, who escaped from Auschwitz in May 1944 and was one of the 4 contributors to the Auschwitz protocols; Richard Glazar, a survivor of Treblinka and war crimes trial witness; and Helge Grabitz, a senior prosecutor in Hamburg of Nazi war criminals."

            "box_content": "The mass killing of 5.6-5.8 million Jews by Nazi Germany and its allies during World War II. Systematic killings of Jews by mass shootings began in summer 1941 in the occupied Soviet Union. By the end of that year, the Nazis began establishing extermination sites for the European Jewry using poison gas. Since 1933, the Nazi party had developed ever more radical policies against targeted groups in different ways, first in Germany and later in all annexed and occupied territories, including North Africa. The Holocaust was a global event, since Jews from many parts of the world were killed in Europe while European Jews were forced to emigrate to the Middle East, the Americas, Asia and other continents. The term Holocaust has also come to refer to the Nazis\u2019 persecution and killing of Roma, eugenics policies victims, homosexuals, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, political opponents, Soviet prisoners of war, and forced laborers. The Visual History Archive contains over 54,000 audiovisual testimonies of Holocaust witnesses recorded between 1981 and 2020 . The largest collection was recorded by the USC Shoah Foundation (51,566), while major contributions include the collections of a consortium of Canadian archives and museums (1,257), the Jewish Family and Children's Services (JFCS) of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin and Sonoma Counties (923). The majority of the interviews are with Jewish Holocaust survivors. The archive also includes the testimonies of political prisoners, Roma (Gypsy) survivors, Jehovah's Witness survivors, survivors of eugenics policies, and homosexual survivors as well as rescuers, liberators, and participants in war crimes trials. USC Shoah Foundation interviews were conducted by a single interviewer, while JFCS interviews were in many instances conducted by two. Interviewees\u00a0were typically\u00a0encouraged to share their\u00a0stories\u00a0in chronological order, recalling memories from before, during, and after\u00a0World War II. At the end of the interview,\u00a0they displayed\u00a0photographs, documents, and artifacts pertaining to\u00a0their family and wartime experiences, and\u00a0then introduced family members and friends on camera. Around 159\u00a0testimonies\u00a0conclude with\u00a0walking interviews,\u00a0filmed at sites of former concentration camps, ghettos, mass graves, hiding places, or in front of prewar family homes. The indexing of each interview enables researchers to search in detail for\u00a0the people, places, events, and experiences described in each one. For example, the archive includes over 1.2 million name records\u2014those of the interviewees themselves, their family members and anyone else they talk about in the interview. The indexing terms include\u00a0approximately 47,000 specific geographic locations, not only from Europe but from all over the world, and\u00a0around 8,000\u00a0experiential terms used to\u00a0describe the\u00a0huge variety of events, experiences, organizations, and other subjects\u00a0(browse the latter in the Thesaurus ).

            "box_title": "Hungary",
            "box_content": "The Hungarian experience is one of the largest subjects of the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive. More than 8,250 of the archive's interviewees talk about Hungary in the periods before, during, and after World War II - and over 6,000 of them were born there. Additionally, almost 5,000 interviewees talk about the areas of Czechoslovakia , Romania , and Yugoslavia that Hungary annexed during World War II . The collection includes 1,370 interviews in the Hungarian language and 808 conducted in Hungary. The expansion of the Hungary's borders between 1938 and 1941 was an attempt to rectify the perceived injustices of the Versailles Treaty, by which significant portions of what was once traditionally considered Hungary had been given to its neighbors after World War I. The country's association with Nazi Germany assisted the process. As Czechoslovakia was dismembered by Germany, Hungary acquired territory. In November 1938, in accordance with the First Vienna Award, Hungary gained a strip of southern Slovakia and western Subcarpathia referred to as Felvid\u00e9k. In March 1939, the Hungarians annexed the remaining part of Subcarpathia, known as K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja (today part of Western Ukraine ). Around 4,900 interviewees were born in these two regions. Under the Second Vienna Award, Hungary acquired large sections of prewar Romania too, in August 1940 annexing Northern Transylvania, birthplace of almost 1,700 interviewees. In the wake of the German invasion of Yugoslavia of April 1941, Hungary was able to annex parts of that country. Collectively known as Delvid\u00e9k, these were sections of the Baranja, Backa, and Banat (today part of northern Serbia), as well as small portions of Medjumurje (northern Croatia) and Prekomurje (north eastern Slovenia); this was the birthplace of almost 250 interviewees. Some testimonies from these areas refer to the Novi Sad Massacre (January 21-23, 1942). The expansion of Hungary's borders brought with it an increase in the number of non-Hungarian citizens, something that concerned the K\u00fclf\u00f6ldieket Ellen\u00f5rz\u00f5 Orsz\u00e1gos K\u00f6zponti Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g (National Center Alien Control Office). Many internment camps were established in Hungary. After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in summer 1941, Hungarian forces briefly administered some towns in south-western Ukraine (prewar Poland), including Skala and Kolomyja. Hungarian authorities deported a large number of Jews without Hungarian citizenship to this area. In August, over 23,000 of these \"alien\" Jews were massacred by German and Ukrainian forces in Kamenets-Podol'skii. Within the borders of the expanded Hungary, anti-Jewish laws were enacted. From 1939 on, men of draft age were conscripted into the forced labor service (Munkaszolg\u00e1lat), part of the Hungarian army not given weapons and that performed menial and dangerous tasks on the front lines (at least 2,700 interviews relate to this experience). Conscripts to the forced labor battalions often avoided deportation to Auschwitz and were generally marched to camps in Germany and Austria only in late 1944-early 1945. Others were shot, for example in the Pusztav\u00e1m Massacre (October 16, 1944). To head off Hungary's negotiations with the Allies, Germany invaded on March 19, 1944. Immediately, they set about enacting the Final Solution at unprecedented speed, assisted by the Hungarian authorities and gendarmerie. Ghettos were established across Hungary and its annexed territories as early as April 1944 (the archive contains information on 172 ghettos in wartime Hungary). Shortly afterwards Jews were being deported en masse to Auschwitz. By that summer, the countryside\u2014everywhere except for Budapest\u2014was Judenrein. Attempts were made to rescue Hungarian Jewry. Almost 190 testimonies discuss the Kasztner transport, a trainload of Jews from Cluj/Koloszvar who were saved from deportation to Auschwitz by Rezs\u00f6 Kazstner's negotiations with Adolf Eichmann. Others were also diverted from Auschwitz, such as the \"Strasshof transports\". In the capital Budapest, there was initially no ghetto. Instead in summer 1944, Jews were required to move to \"Yellow Star houses\" (discussed in over 1,000 testimonies). Others were sheltered in the so-called \"international ghetto\"\u2014Swedish, Swiss, and Spanish protected houses (830 interviews). The actions of consular officials of those nations and of the Vatican contributed to the rescue of thousands. Many Jews in Budapest went into hiding (over 700 testimonies) and/or assumed false identities (over 1,100 testimonies). There are over 230 interviews with survivors who hid in Budapest and who were involved in the underground. Various Zionist organizations were active in the underground in the city, including the Va'adat Ezra ve'Hatzalah. In numerous testimonies, the role of the Arrow Cross (Hungarian fascist party) is discussed, especially after its leader Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi came to power in a coup in October 1944. In November 1944, the Budapest ghetto was established (over 800 interviews). Deportations from the ghetto soon became impossible as the Soviets surrounded the city; executions took place in a nearby racetrack. The archive contains over 1,600 survivors who were liberated in Budapest, including around 370 from the Budapest ghetto in January 1945. With the end of the war, Budapest became a city through which people traveled searching for relatives, and en route to former homes. Many opted to leave, some immediately, some after the Communist takeover. Over 360 testimonies discuss the 1956 Revolution, around the time of which many more interviewees fled Hungary. Some of those who remained were involved in the Communist administration.

            "box_content": "The Hungarian experience is one of the largest subjects of the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive. More than 8,250 of the archive's interviewees talk about Hungary in the periods before, during, and after World War II - and over 6,000 of them were born there. Additionally, almost 5,000 interviewees talk about the areas of Czechoslovakia , Romania , and Yugoslavia that Hungary annexed during World War II . The collection includes 1,370 interviews in the Hungarian language and 808 conducted in Hungary. The expansion of the Hungary's borders between 1938 and 1941 was an attempt to rectify the perceived injustices of the Versailles Treaty, by which significant portions of what was once traditionally considered Hungary had been given to its neighbors after World War I. The country's association with Nazi Germany assisted the process. As Czechoslovakia was dismembered by Germany, Hungary acquired territory. In November 1938, in accordance with the First Vienna Award, Hungary gained a strip of southern Slovakia and western Subcarpathia referred to as Felvid\u00e9k. In March 1939, the Hungarians annexed the remaining part of Subcarpathia, known as K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja (today part of Western Ukraine ). Around 4,900 interviewees were born in these two regions. Under the Second Vienna Award, Hungary acquired large sections of prewar Romania too, in August 1940 annexing Northern Transylvania, birthplace of almost 1,700 interviewees. In the wake of the German invasion of Yugoslavia of April 1941, Hungary was able to annex parts of that country. Collectively known as Delvid\u00e9k, these were sections of the Baranja, Backa, and Banat (today part of northern Serbia), as well as small portions of Medjumurje (northern Croatia) and Prekomurje (north eastern Slovenia); this was the birthplace of almost 250 interviewees. Some testimonies from these areas refer to the Novi Sad Massacre (January 21-23, 1942). The expansion of Hungary's borders brought with it an increase in the number of non-Hungarian citizens, something that concerned the K\u00fclf\u00f6ldieket Ellen\u00f5rz\u00f5 Orsz\u00e1gos K\u00f6zponti Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g (National Center Alien Control Office). Many internment camps were established in Hungary. After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in summer 1941, Hungarian forces briefly administered some towns in south-western Ukraine (prewar Poland), including Skala and Kolomyja. Hungarian authorities deported a large number of Jews without Hungarian citizenship to this area. In August, over 23,000 of these \"alien\" Jews were massacred by German and Ukrainian forces in Kamenets-Podol'skii. Within the borders of the expanded Hungary, anti-Jewish laws were enacted. From 1939 on, men of draft age were conscripted into the forced labor service (Munkaszolg\u00e1lat), part of the Hungarian army not given weapons and that performed menial and dangerous tasks on the front lines (at least 2,700 interviews relate to this experience). Conscripts to the forced labor battalions often avoided deportation to Auschwitz and were generally marched to camps in Germany and Austria only in late 1944-early 1945. Others were shot, for example in the Pusztav\u00e1m Massacre (October 16, 1944). To head off Hungary's negotiations with the Allies, Germany invaded on March 19, 1944. Immediately, they set about enacting the Final Solution at unprecedented speed, assisted by the Hungarian authorities and gendarmerie.

            "box_content": "In Italy, the USC Shoah Foundation conducted 418 video testimonies between September 1997 and June 2000, using 43 interviewers in 48 locations. These interviews comprise 403 Jewish survivors, 10 rescuers, three Roma survivors, one political prisoner, and one war crimes trial participant. However, these are only a part of the full collection of Italian testimonies. The USC Shoah Foundation recorded 488 interviews with people born in Italy, in 63 different cities\u2014Rome especially (155, or 32%), and also notably Rhodes, Milan, Turin, Trieste, Florence, Genoa, and Fiume. From a broader perspective, there are over 3,800 interviewees who discuss their experiences in Italy before, during, and after World War II. Moreover, if we include their experiences in the zones of Italian military occupation, then this number rises to more than 5,000. Despite Italy being a fascist dictatorship since October 1922, levels of antisemitism in the early years were low and the attitudes of Jewish families toward Dictator Benito Mussolini (discussed in 166 testimonies) were not always negative. As Mussolini sought closer ties with Nazi Germany, this began to change, especially with the enactment of Racial Defense Laws in 1938\u20131939 (269 testimonies). As a German ally during World War II, Italy occupied regions of Greece, southern France, and Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, interviewees often report that Italian soldiers, police, officials and civilians often displayed sympathy and humane treatment toward Jews, to the extent that many actively tried to flee to Italy or to areas of Italian occupation. There were also rescue operations organized by individual Italians. A group of Jewish children from Yugoslavia was rescued from Yugoslavia and kept in safety during the war at the Villa Emma near Modena (6 testimonies). In German-occupied Budapest in 1944, the efforts of two Italians saved thousands of Jews: diplomat and Spanish embassy official Giorgio Perlasca (9 testimonies) and papal nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta (5 testimonies). In Italy itself during the war, a system of \u201cenforced residence\u201d kept those deemed politically suspect in remote rural locations. Internment camps were set up such as at Ferramonti-Tarsia (81 testimonies), Campagna (10 testimonies), and Urbisaglia Bonservizi (5 testimonies). But there was no campaign to exterminate the Jewish population. With the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 8, 1943, the situation was transformed: Germany invaded Italy and attempted to enact the same anti-Jewish policies as elsewhere in Europe. Jews were rounded up in the cities, most famously on October 16, 1943, in Rome (91 testimonies). In tracking down Jews, the Germans were assisted by the Italian police, fascist squads such as the Bande Nere (23 testimonies), and local collaborators, including the notorious Jewish collaborator Celeste Di Porto (21 testimonies). Deportations transported many of those found to Poland and Germany. The USC Shoah Foundation has 77 interviews with Italian Jewish survivors of Auschwitz. Additional concentration camps were opened at Fossoli (40 testimonies), Risiera di San Sabba (14 testimonies), Borgo San Dalmazzo (7 testimonies), and Bolzano (Bozen-Gries, 6 testimonies), among other places. In March 1944, the SS shot 335 Italians, including 78 Jews, at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome (31 testimonies); other massacres took place at the Hotel Meina by Lake Maggiore (2 testimonies) and Sant'Anna di Stazzema (2 testimonies). To survive, many Italian Jews went into hiding or concealed their identities (368 testimonies). Some were involved in the resistance (82 testimonies), in groups such as Brigate Garibaldi, Brigate Giustizia e Libert\u00e1, and Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale. The Delegazione Assistenza Emigranti Ebrei (DELASEM), the Jewish agency that helped foreign Jewish refugees in Italy, continued its work throughout the war albeit in increasingly clandestine ways (27 testimonies). In total, around 20% of the Italian Jewish population was killed in the Holocaust. Immediately after the war ended, between 1945 and 1947, thousands of refugees who perhaps otherwise had no connection to Italy passed through the numerous Allied displaced persons camps and refugee camps established there (over 2,100 interviewees). The USC Shoah Foundation recorded 434 interviews in the Italian language.

The following essay was contributed by Professor Giovanni Contini Bonacossi (Sapienza - Universit\u00e0 di Roma), one of three people to index the USC Shoah Foundation's Italian-language testimonies. The Italian Jews: Survival and Memory The identity of Italian Jews, in pre-fascist Italy, was quite weak. After their emancipation in the XIX century, they identified deeply with the newly born Italian Nation and Italian State. They participated in the Risorgimento (the movement which ended up with the Italian Independence) at a rate much higher than that of ordinary Italians, they fought bravely during World War I, and many of them joined the Fascist Party in the early 1920s - or were at least not particularly hostile to the new movement and to the Fascist Regime. During the 20 years of Fascist rule their assimilation was even increased by the presence of the totalitarian state, which tended more broadly to increase conformism and to destroy diversity. When the Italian Racial laws were implemented in 1938, the vast majority of the Italian Jews were taken completely by surprise, anti-Semitism having always been quite a minor phenomenon in Italy. In the following years, though, Italian Jews experienced persecution, a sharp increase in anti-Semitism as a result of strong anti-Semitic propaganda in the press, and very little solidarity from their fellow citizens. Until September 1943, though, their lives were never under threat. But when the Germans occupied Italy and Mussolini re-established a sort of caricature of the Fascist Regime, the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, the Germans and Italian Fascists alike started a quite efficient search for the Jews. Many were captured and sent to camps in Germany and Poland. In Italy from 1943 to 1945, Jews had to find shelter in villages in the mountains, where nobody could recognize them. They had to look for food, but had very little money. Some of them managed to flee to Switzerland, while others were not accepted at the border and were then arrested by the Germans. Very few of those who were arrested and sent to the camps ever came back. During the two terrible years, survivors say, they could enjoy an amazing solidarity with the majority of the Italians. Jews were given false papers, financial support, shelter, and food. Unlike the German, Polish or even the French Jews, the Italian Jews managed to survive thanks to their fellow citizens. It is said that survivors in Italy are by no question more numerous than in many other European countries. Yet even this memory is not completely true. First of all, it is only the memory of those who managed to find \u201cgood\u201d Italians, since those who were betrayed cannot come back to tell their story. And from other documents we know that the unlucky ones were not so few. Besides, this explanation of the help being motivated by the \u201cgood\u201d nature of the Italians is quite unconvincing, particularly when compared to the behaviour of the Italian Army in Yugoslavia during the war, or in Ethiopia during the 1930s, when the Italian Army perpetrated a long series of murders and massacres of the civilian population. The Italians helped the Jews, in my opinion, primarily within the framework of the civil war. When the Resistance started, and when even the Church had yet to choose sides, the antifascist movement started to protect the Jews, and at the same time the Repubblichini together with the German policemen started to arrest them. I think that the very lack of solidarity from 1938 to 1943 shows how even the aid from 1943 to 1945 was related to the political context. There is another aspect of Jewish survivor memory which is disputable, namely that of those few who managed to survive the camps: often a close analysis shows that the witnesses have \u201cwrong\u201d memories. Witnesses very often introduce pieces of information which fail to fit the rest of their narrative. This applies to people who were deported to Auschwitz, who recall events they had experienced in other camps. It also applies to those people who were inmates in Mauthausen who claimed to have met doctor Mengele - who, of course, was at Auschwitz. Many testimonies of the Shoah were recorded years, if not decades, after the events. Furthermore although witnesses were very much aware of the fact that what they had experienced was terribly important, not all were immediately willing to talk about those experiences. First of all, these people had to restart their lives, and the memories of persecution were a permanent threat to the continuation of life itself. These memories, literally, had a paralyzing effect on people, who often report, when interviewed, stories about their life-long struggle against that memory. Some people did not want to talk because they were certain that \u201cnobody would have possibly believed our tales\u201d. This idea suggests that even those who were prepared to listen to their stories might not have believed them. I believe, however, that the real problem is a different one: that it was the witness him- or herself who was unable to produce a convincing account of the facts. It was the witness who did not dare to recount the facts because they were too stark. The witness, admittedly, was trying to protect close relatives, particularly children and loved ones, from the sheer brutality of what they had experienced. We know a lot about the morale of prisoners of concentration camps, where all moral principles were reversed. In that hell, those who clung to their conscience were destined to a quick death. Survivors from the camps often tell stories about their fellow-inmates, maintaining that after a few days \u201ceverybody was on his own\u201d, that any sense of solidarity was gone. They have stories about people stealing soup from the hands of a dying prisoner, or of stealing socks from somebody after their own socks were stolen, although they knew full well that no one could survive barefoot in the camp. There are even cruder stories, of mothers stealing food from their children, and even episodes of cannibalism. It was a situation in which the human ability to articulate moral judgments simply did not apply. I believe that inaccuracy in reporting facts has to do with both the objective conditions of the concentration camps, and the ways the same experience was recounted so many years later. The survivors were common people, and their actions were guided by shared moral principles. The camp represented a nightmarish reversal of the system of values they were used to depending on. Their right was said to be wrong, and the wrong right. Inmates had to hold back their feelings in order to survive and yield to a process of emotional and moral anesthesia. All energies and intellectual resources were focused on how to get through the day, and this pushed any other thought away. They did things they would never do in a \u201cnormal\u201d situation. They no longer had emotions and feelings they would normally have. Once back in normal life, they often experience guilt when remembering the camp, about what they did and what they were forced to do. Their memory had, in a sense, been amputated memory. When they decided to speak out after many years, they seemed to be able to recall only some micro-events that would not make much sense in a \u201cnormal\u201d context - memories, for instance, related to food, clothes, and sleep. And of course fear. But they appeared to have forgotten other simple \u201cfacts\u201d, such as the shape of the camp, the nationality of the other prisoners, the chronology of the events. These details they seemed to have forgotten, although, in a sense, one might say that they had never experienced them. Sometimes survivors remember clearly the name of the first camp and the events which took place there, but their memory seems to fade away when they have to remember the second camp, and the third. They seem to forget even the name of the camps, and be unable to talk about the events which took place there. Testimonies given so late, concerning such an extreme kind of experience, are likely to convey mistakes and improprieties. Witnesses strive to fill the many gaps in their tales, gaps that somehow reproduce the gaps in their first experience of the camp. Sometimes they invent the facts they want to talk about within a framework borrowed from books about the Shoah, and insert, albeit unconsciously, part of a book\u2019s narrative into their own account. Sometimes they \u201csteal\u201d facts from television programs. But I think that even these \u201cfalse\u201d memories tell us a lot both about how the survivors experienced life in the camps, and the working-out of their memory of that experience after the Shoah.

            "box_content": "Approximately 90 percent of the Jewish community of Lithuania was killed during the Holocaust. The USC Shoah Foundation's archive has interviews with 1,110 interviews born in Lithuania (1,095 Jewish survivors , 11 rescuers, 3 liberators, 1 war crimes trial participants). Interviewees talk, above all, about the three main cities of Lithuania: Kaunas (Kovno); Siauliai (Shavli); and Vilnius (Vilna), the historical capital of Lithuania but incorporated into the independent country only in 1939 and known as the \"Jerusalem of the East\" on account of the vibrancy of its Jewish religious and cultural life. The changes brought about by the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in the summer of 1940 are discussed: the nationalization of businesses, restrictions on religious life, changes in education, and the deportation of individuals and families to the East. Between 1939 and 1941, huge numbers of refugees fleeing from Poland arrived in Lithuania. A number of witnesses talk about Chiune (Sempo) Sugihara, the Japanese vice consul in Kaunas, who in July-August 1940 issued between 1,600 and 3,500 transit visas that enabled Jewish refugees to move from Lithuania to Dutch-controlled Cura\u00e7ao via Japan and the Soviet Union. The archive includes the interview of his widow, Yukiko Sugihara (in Japanese and English). The mass executions of Jews in Lithuania began immediately after the arrival of the Germans in summer 1941, at execution sites such as the Ponary Forest near Vilnius and the Ninth Fort in Kaunas . Large ghettos were established in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Siauliai. Life in these ghettos is described in considerable detail, as are the major figures connected to them (such as Jacob Gens, the head of the Vilna ghetto Judenrat). The archive also includes survivors of lesser-known ghettos on Lithuanian territory (Butrimonys, Erzvilkas, Latkiskes, Kedainiai, Panevezys, Telsiai, Vabalninkas, Vilkaviskis, Zagare, Ziezmariai) and Polish/Lithuanian territory (e.g. Swieciany, Oszmiana, Troki). Resistance in the ghettos is a major topic of discussion: in particular the Vilna ghetto resistance groups FPO and Yechiel and figures such as Josef Glazman, as well as the resistance in the Kovno ghetto. Many escapees from the ghettos joined partisan groups in the forests. Survivors note the role of Lithuanian police and irregulars (e.g. such as the Ypatingi Buriai) in assisting the Germans in the mass killings and policing the ghettos; a small number discuss the Lietuviu Aktyvistu Frontas, the nationalist group formed in Germany in 1940. Survivors also describe several labor camps in Lithuania. In the unusual case of the Kailis and HKP work camps in Vilnius, prisoners tried to avoid the liquidation of the Vilna ghetto by hiding there. Others survived by hiding and by assuming a false identity, sometimes helped by the local population. There are 11 rescuers who gave testimonies in Lithuanian. They describe how they and their families were able to save Jews during the war in Kaunas and other locations. In total, the USC Shoah Foundation's archive contains over 2,000 testimonies with discussions relating to Lithuania - these were conducted in various languages (including 45 interviews in Lithuanian) and in several different countries (137 in Lithuania).

            "box_content": "The interviews of the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive are a major resource shedding light on a less well known area of European history, the Holocaust in Romania. As many as 5,264 interviewees discuss their experiences in Romania before, during, and after World War II. In total, 3,893 interviewees were born in cities in Romania but emigrated, or did not return, after the war. The USC Shoah Foundation conducted 146 interviews in Romania and 129 interviews in the Romanian language. The Romanian collection can be subdivided into three groups: survivors from Transylvania, the north western region occupied by Hungary during the war; those from the north eastern provinces Bessarabia and Bukovina who were expelled into southern Ukraine (Transnistria); and those from the Regat or \"rump\" Romania. The largest part of the Romanian collection includes the 1,803 interviewees who were born in the provinces of Crisana Maramures and Transylvania, an area that had been part of Austria-Hungary until 1918. The majority of the Jewish survivors from these areas fell under Hungarian occupation in 1940. Most were deported to local ghettos and subsequently to Auschwitz in 1944. Others, usually male survivors, were sent to work in the forced labor companies of the Hungarian army. Some 1,357 interviewees were born in the Romanian interwar provinces of Bessarabia and Bukovina, which were annexed by the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940. One year later, in summer 1941, the German and Romanian armies occupied the area and deported most of the Jewish population to Transnistria, the area of south-western Ukraine between the rivers Dniester and Bug that the Romanians occupied until 1944. There, they were kept in often appalling conditions in ghettos, camps, and colonies, and were subject to mass execution, forced labor, and disease. Some managed to avoid deportation and remained in the ghetto in Cernauti (Czernowitz/Chernovtsy). The 733 interviewees who were born in the Regat, the Old Kingdom area which remained Romania before, during, and after World War II, had very different wartime experiences. The Holocaust history of this region is less well known. While most Jews in the Regat mostly avoided the excesses of the Holocaust, they faced poor treatment at home. A small number of work camps (Cobadin, Craiova, Osmancea, Targu-Jiu) and ghettos (Ismail, Bacau) are discussed. In more than 100 testimonies, interviewees talk about their compulsory involvement in forced labor groups under the auspices of the Romanian army. The archive includes survivors of the Jassy (Iasi) pogrom, the largest massacre of Jews conducted on Romanian soil. A few survivors talk about life in and around the cities Bazargic and Silistra, which were occupied by Bulgaria during the war.

            "box_content": "In Russia, the Holocaust reached its easternmost point in Europe and extended across a vast expanse of land. From historic Pushkin on the outskirts of Leningrad in the north to Nal\u2032chik and Mozdok in the Caucasus Mountains in the south, the total area of Russia that the Germans came to control was virtually as big as both Ukraine and Belorussia put together. Unlike lands further west, the Russian territories were always close to the front lines and, as a result, were exclusively under German military, rather than civilian, administration for the entirety of the occupation. Here, Jews were not deported but were killed on the spot\u2014in mass shootings or occasionally in hermetically sealed \u201cgas vans\u201d. Ghettos and a few camps were established. Remarkably, some areas that were occupied for only a very short period of time\u2014occasionally as little as two months\u2014were left Judenrein by the time the Red Army had retaken control. Conversely, various factors meant that the Jewish population of Russia was decimated somewhat less than elsewhere. Because they resided in the easternmost region the Germans were to reach, Russian Jews had perhaps the greatest opportunity to learn of Nazi atrocities as well as the shortest distances to flee to safety; furthermore, Moscow and Leningrad, the cities with the largest Jewish populations in the USSR, were never captured. Those who survived the German occupation in Russia were usually those who could pass as non-Jews. As such they endured the \u201cnormal\u201d treatment meted out by the Germans to the local population: starvation, forced labor, and deportation\u2014whether as prisoners-of-war or as Ostarbeiters. Despite the size of the region affected and the numbers of people killed (between 119,000 and 140,000), the Holocaust in Russia has received relatively little scholarly attention and is not well known by the public. The testimonies of the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive contain references to 28 ghettos in occupied Russia\u2014both the better known examples in northern and central regions (e.g. Kaluga, Il'ino, Smolensk, and Usviaty) as well as virtually unknown ghetto-like facilities in rural areas of southern Russia and the Caucasus region. In addition, interviewees discuss at least 20 concentration camps and 32 prisoner of war camps in Russia. The experiences of Jewish ethnicities are also represented: the Mountain Jews in and around the city of Nal\u2019chik and the Krymchaks and Karaites in the Crimea. A large number of these relate to the experiences of Polish Jews deported to Siberia after the Soviets annexed Eastern Poland in 1939; they describe exile in remote areas of Russia (Komi ASSR, Arkhangel\u2019sk Oblast, Siberia). The USC Shoah Foundation collected 677 interviews in the Russian Federation. See also: USSR"

Victims of the genocide also included tens of thousands of so-called Hutu in opposition to the Hutu extremists. The mass murder was the climax of a larger postcolonial history of Tutsi persecution by the Hutus, who shared language, culture and religion, but had been earlier constructed as different groups by the Belgian colonial power. The Visual History Archive contains the testimonies of 135 witnesses of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda. They were recorded in Rwanda and the United States between 2004 and 2019 by the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center , USC Shoah Foundation (15), Holocaust Museum Houston , and for the documentary film \"The 600: A Soldier's Story.\" The interview languages are Kinyarwanda, English, or French; all the Kinyarwanda testimonies have English subtitles.

            "box_content": "The USC Shoah Foundation has a collection of 407 video interviews with Roma survivors of persecution by the Nazis and their Allies. They were gathered in 18 countries and in 16 languages between November 1995 and November 1999. The interviewees, 185 men and 222 women, were predominantly from Poland and Ukraine and gave their testimonies mostly in the Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian languages; a smaller group of testimonies are from western and southern Europe. Around half of the interviewees report that they led nomadic lives before, during, and after the war. Over three quarters relate that they were from Romani-speaking communities; 24 testimonies are exclusively in the Romani language. They describe their families, traditions, Christian and Muslim religious observances, relations between different Roma groups, as well as relations with the local population. Nazi and Axis persecution of Roma during World War II took various forms. Around 100 Roma survivors were prisoners of camps in Poland\u2014including the \u201cZigeunerlager\u201d in Auschwitz-Birkenau\u2014as well as Austria, Germany, Ukraine, Latvia, and other countries. Thirty eight discuss their experiences in ghettos in Ukraine especially, but also in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Forty one were witnesses to executions; for example, the five accounts of a mass shooting in Aleksandrovka (Smolensk oblast, Russia) make this the most witnessed single execution in Russia among the Institute\u2019s testimonies. Many interviewees talk about continuing persecution after the war and describe the efforts of various governments to force the Roma to establish permanent settlements and to participate in state-led integration schemes.

            "box_content": "In Slovakia , Jews were not under direct German rule but were subject to a regime that strove to follow national socialist ideals. Beginning in 1939, a series of anti-Jewish measures were introduced; from 1941, Jewish men were sent to work for the Slovak Sixth Labor Battalion. The mass deportation of Jews began in March 1942. Slovak Jews were some of the first prisoners to be deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The archive includes testimonies of prisoners who survived from that time (e.g. Ria Elias, interview code 25023, Portuguese). Several testimonies discuss the Slovak escapees from Auschwitz , Rudolf Vrba (Walter Rosenberg), Josef Lanik (Alfred Wetzler). A unique aspect of Slovak Holocaust history is the activity of the \"Working Group\" (Pracovn\u00e1 Skupina). This organization was made up of members of the \u00dastredna Zidov (the Slovak Judenrat) who, through a variety of methods including bribery, attempted to save Slovak Jews from deportation. Partly as a result of their efforts, the deportations were stopped in October 1942. The Working Group played a major role in getting the camps Sered', Nov\u00e1ky, and Vyhne designated as labor camps so that their Jewish specialist workforces would be safe from deportation. The USC Shoah Foundation's archive includes interviews of Andrew Steiner (interview code 5154, English), the last living member of Working Group; Emanuel Frieder (interview code 7202, Hebrew), brother of rabbi Armin Frieder of the Working Group; and Gideon Frieder (interview code 22840, English), rabbi Frieder's son. Vladim\u00edr Bachn\u00e1r (interview code 24550, Slovak), a member of the communist underground, discusses his activities in the Working Group as an insider in the deportations department of the Judenrat. The archive also includes the testimony of Ernest [Arnost] Rosin (interview code 32034, German), a Slovak Jew who escaped from Auschwitz in May 1944 and was one of the four contributors to the Auschwitz Protocols, a report on the mass killings at the camp. Transit camps/deportation centers such as Nitra , Poprad, Zilina, and others are discussed in a number of testimonies. Interviews also relate the activities of the Hlinka Guard and the Freiwillige Schutzstaffel, the Slovak and ethnic-German militias. At least 200 interviews include discussions of the Slovak National Uprising of 1944 and its subsequent collapse. The archive contains a number of interviews with partisans who fought in the uprising. Survivors who participated were able to remain in Slovakia until liberation, hiding in the mountains and forests. The Slovak National Uprising is discussed especially in the Slovak-language interviews. Among them, Alexander Bachn\u00e1r (interview code 14754, Slovak; cousin of the aforementioned Vladim\u00edr Bachn\u00e1r) was one of the Jewish partisan commanders of the uprising; another Jewish partisan figure is Bernard Knezo (interview code 17272, Slovak). Among the rarer experiences recounted in the testimonies are those of the wartime Slovakian administration of a small area of southern Poland , including the town of Jurg\u00f3w . Among the non-Jewish interviewees is Anton Rasla (interview code 20285, Slovak), who was the chief prosecutor in the postwar trial of Jozef Tiso. An example of a Slovak rescuer is Stefan Pancik (interview code 37777, Slovak), whose family protected Andrew Steiner and others. Southern Slovakia ( Felvid\u00e9k) Over 1,500 interviewees were born in the area of southern Slovakian border around Kosice that came under Hungarian rule after March 1939 and was known in Hungarian as Felvid\u00e9k. Hungarian authorities immediately enacted several anti-Jewish laws. The Hungarian army began to draft men of age into the forced labor service (Munkaszolg\u00e1lat), a section of the army that performed menial and dangerous tasks on the front lines without weaponry (at least 1,700 interviews in total describe this experience). Conscripts to the forced labor battalions often avoided deportation to Auschwitz, instead being marched to camps in Germany and Austria in late 1944-early 1945. The first deportations took place in summer 1941. Hungarian authorities expelled a large number of Jews without Hungarian citizenship to the Skala and Kolomyja area of southwestern Ukraine (prewar Poland ), an event described in over 250 testimonies. In August, they handed over 23,000 of these so-called alien Jews to German and Ukrainian forces, who massacred them in Kamenets-Podol'skii. The area experienced the full force of the Final Solution after the German invasion of Hungary on March 19, 1944. Immediately, the Germans set about aggressively enacting the Final Solution, assisted by the Hungarian authorities and gendarmerie. Ghettos were established as early as the next month. In May 1944, Jews were being deported en masse to Auschwitz , and by that summer, the area was Judenrein. Almost all of these interviews of witnesses born in the southern Slovakia ( Felvid\u00e9k) region were conducted in other parts of the world and in various languages, attesting to the widespread emigration of the surviving Jewish community from the area. The Shoah Foundation Institute conducted 664 interviews in Slovakia and 573 in the Slovak language. Around 1,900 of the archive's interviewees were born in what is today Slovakia.

The help given to Jews by the Spanish consulate in Budapest is covered in a small number of interviews; the role of Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian who worked in the Spanish embassy issuing protection papers and assigning safe houses to Jews, is discussed in particular. Some interviewees discuss their encounters with members of \"La Divisi\u00f3n Azul\", the Spanish troops who volunteered for the German Army and who fought on the Russian front. From the prewar period, there are first-hand descriptions of the Spanish Civil War, including testimonies of participants in the International Brigades. On other testimonies, there are mentions of Spanish civil war veterans who were encountered in French internment camps and camps in Austria during World War II. The USC Shoah Foundation gathered 1,354 Spanish-language interviews, almost all in Central and South America. Seven interviews were recorded in Spain, all with Jewish survivors, 6 in Spanish and 1 in German. These interviewees came from various parts of Europe (Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Yugoslavia) and settled in Spain after the war."

Among them are 3,427 interviews conducted in Ukraine, 304 interviews conducted in the Ukrainian language and 43 in a combination of Russian and Ukrainian. Ukraine has been an independent country only since 1991. On the eve of World War II, most of modern-day Ukrainian territory\u2014the center, east and south\u2014was part of the USSR , while western Ukraine was divided between Poland , Czechoslovakia , and Romania . As a result, USC Shoah Foundation interviewees talk about Ukraine in various languages, and the experiences during World War II they describe differ considerably from region to region\u2014under German, Romanian, or Hungarian occupation. German-Occupied Ukraine After the German invasion of the USSR in summer 1941, most Jews were not deported to death camps but simply executed on the spot. Mass shootings took place both on a large scale, such as at Babi Yar in Kyiv, as well as on a small scale\u2014in numerous massacres conducted in rural locations. Ghettos and camps were established to collect Jews and to exploit them for forced labor, prior to execution; some local Ukrainians were involved in the German-organized local police forces and administrations. Jewish survivors in the archive describe escaping from executions, going into hiding, and fleeing to join the Soviet partisans or further east to Soviet controlled areas. Some who could pass as non-Jews were deported as forced laborers ( Ostarbeiter ) to Germany along with Ukrainians and other Slavs. Ukrainian Roma faced similar experiences to the Jews, and examples can be found in the 135 Roma survivor interviews the Shoah Foundation Institute recorded in Ukraine. While their war experiences may have similarities, the prewar lives of those born in the areas of Ukraine that had been in the USSR and those born in the areas that had been in Poland were substantially different. By the time World War II started, the over 4,500 interviewees born in the Ukrainian Republic of the USSR had already experienced the ravages of collectivization and \u201cdekulakization,\u201d the 1932-33 Famine (discussed in over 700 interviews), massive restrictions on religious life, and the wave of Stalinist political repressions known as the Purge. All of these events are described significantly in the archive\u2019s interviews. On the other side of the Curzon Line, the nearly 2,000 interviewees born in the regions of western Ukraine that were in Poland from 1918 to 1939, while not entirely free of restrictions, lived comparatively freely. Jews were able to observe many forms of Judaism, and both the Greek Catholic and Orthodox Churches operated alongside the Roman Catholic Church. Zionist groups were active, as were various political movements, although there was little tolerance of communists and Ukrainian nationalists by the Polish government. When the USSR annexed these regions in September 1939, they quickly removed political, religious, and business elites, deporting many to remote areas of northern and eastern Russia, and imposed Soviet power. However, the Soviets had not eradicated all traces of Ukrainian life by the time of the German invasion two years later. Metropolitan Sheptyts\u2019kyi, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Greek Catholic Church, openly castigated those who killed Jews and secretly sheltered Jews in his monasteries. Western Ukraine was also very much the epicenter of activities for the Ukrainian nationalist movement and its military wing (OUN and UPA) during the war, initially in collaboration with the Germans before turning on them, the Poles, and the Soviets. Romanian-Occupied Ukraine Over 1,350 USC Shoah Foundation interviewees were born in the interwar provinces of Bessarabia and Bukovina in Romania , which were annexed by the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940. One year later, in summer 1941, the German and Romanian armies occupied the area and deported most of the region\u2019s Jewish population to Transnistria, the area of south-western Ukraine between the rivers Dniester and Bug that the Romanians occupied until 1944. In Transnistria, the deportees and the local Ukrainian Jews\u2014around 3,200 survivors of whom were interviewed by the USC Shoah Foundation\u2014were kept in often appalling conditions in ghettos, camps, and colonies, and were subject to mass execution, forced labor, and disease. Some managed to avoid deportation and remained in the ghetto in Chernivitsi (Cernauti/Czernowitz/Chernovtsy). An operation organized by the Jewish communities in Bucharest and Palestine was able to rescue Jewish orphans from Transnistria. Hungarian-Occupied Ukraine Around 2,400 of the archive's interviewees were born in the region known as Subcarpathian Rus ' , now part of western Ukraine (Zakarpats ' ka Oblast) but before World War II part of eastern Czechoslovakia ( Podkarpatsk\u00e1 Rus province) . After March 1939, the area was annexed by Hungary and was known in Hungarian as K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja. Hungarian authorities immediately enacted several anti-Jewish laws. The Hungarian army began to draft men of age into the forced labor service (Munkaszolg\u00e1lat), a section of the army that performed menial and dangerous tasks on the front lines without weaponry (at least 1,700 interviews describe this experience). Conscripts to the forced labor battalions often avoided deportation to Auschwitz, instead being marched to camps in Germany and Austria in late 1944-early 1945. In summer 1941, Hungarian authorities expelled a large number of Jews without Hungarian citizenship to the Skala-Podil's'ka and Kolomyia area of southwestern Ukraine, an event described in over 250 testimonies. In August, they handed over 23,000 of these so-called alien Jews to German and Ukrainian forces, who massacred them in Kam'ianets'-Podil's'kyi. The area experienced the full force of the Final Solution after the German invasion of Hungary on March 19, 1944. With the assistance of the Hungarian authorities and gendarmerie, the Germans established ghettos as early as the next month and, by May 1944, Jews were being deported en masse to Auschwitz. By that summer, the area was \u201cJudenrein.\u201d Almost all of these interviews of witnesses born in Subcarpathian Rus ' were conducted in other parts of the world and in various languages, attesting to the widespread emigration of the surviving Jewish community from the area. The USC Shoah Foundation conducted 90 Russian-, Ukrainian-, and Rusyn-language testimonies with Jewish and Roma survivors remaining in what is today Zakarpats'ka oblast of Ukraine. Rescuers and Aid Providers in Ukraine 413 rescuers and aid providers were interviewed in Ukraine, over one third of all the rescuer/aid provider interviews collected by the USC Shoah Foundation. Taking huge risks to their own lives and those of their families, they were able to save from death many Jews, some of whom are also interviewees in the archive.

These include 898 interviews recorded in the United Kingdom. The great majority of these interviews relate to the experiences of Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia who arrived in the United Kingdom on the eve of World War II. While some of these refugees remained in Britain, joined the army, and settled after the war, others emigrated to North America and elsewhere. These interviews discuss the Kindertransports; the role of aid givers such as Nicholas Winton and of organizations such as Bloomsbury House; the dispersal of refugees around the country (including the hakhsharot at Grwych Castle in North Wales and on Lord Balfour's estate at Whittingehame in southern Scotland); the interaction between the refugees and the foster families who took them in; the work experiences of Jewish refugees; the internment of \"enemy aliens\" in camps on the Isle of Man and Isle of Wight and the subsequent deportation of internees to Canada and Australia. Other interviews describe the internment of Jewish refugees attempting to enter Palestine during and after the war, in camps in Palestine, Cyprus, Kenya, Uganda, and Mauritius. A separate part of the British collection pertains to the experiences of Jews serving in the Polish Army-in-Exile (Polish units of the British army), American and Canadian servicemen who spent time in the United Kingdom en route to operations in Europe. A number of rescuers and aid providers, liberators, and war crimes trial participants in the archive were born in the United Kingdom There are 32 Jewish Holocaust survivors in the archive who were born in the United Kingdom. Among the British interviews are those of Hugh Stewart (interview code 39772, English), who worked for the Army Film and Photo Section and filmed the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp; Lord Janner of Braunstone (interview code 46115, English), founder of the All-Party War Crimes Group in 1986-87, which investigated suspected Nazi war criminals living in the United Kingdom."

            "box_content": "The history of the Soviet Union - and the Holocaust in the occupied Soviet Union in particular - is one of largest subjects in the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive, discussed in over 12,500 interviews that include 7,175 in Russian and 304 in Ukrainian. Between 1995 and 1999, USCSF undertook a major effort to record testimonies in the former Soviet Union\u2014including 3,427 interviews in Ukraine , 677 in Russia , and 246 in Belarus \u2014with interviewees who were often still living in the same location as they had before and during World War II. Other survivors from the former Soviet Union were interviewed in Israel, the United States, Germany, and elsewhere. A number of themes are common to interviews describing Soviet experiences: \u2022 General Aspects of Soviet Life Membership (or non-membership) of the Communist Party Participation in the Komsomol and Pioneers Attitudes toward Stalin Life on collective farms Stalinist political repressions (campaigns against private trade, religion, \"kulaks,\" perceived political opponents) Collectivization The famines of 1921, 1932-1933, and 1946-1947 Soviet special settlements and concentration camps Soviet political police, including interviews with people who served in the NKVD. \u2022 Soviet Jewish Life Jewish religious observance in the USSR The closure of Jewish schools and synagogues Jewish kolkhozes Jews serving in the Soviet army Issues of Jewish and Soviet identity and anti-Semitism in the USSR \u201c5th line of the Soviet passport\u201d \u201cAnti-cosmopolitan\u201d campaign \u201cDoctor\u2019s Plot\u201d Birobidzhan, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. Additionally, the Visual History Archive includes rare interviews with Bukharan Jews, Karaites, Krimchaks, and Mountain Jews. \u2022 The Holocaust in the Soviet Union Evacuation and flight of civilians in the wake of the Axis invasion of June 22, 1941. Mass shootings both large (such as at Babi Yar in Kyiv) and small (numerous massacres conducted in rural locations); executions using gas vans; subsequent Nazi efforts to cover up traces of mass killings, e.g. as conducted by Sonderkommando 1005 units. The establishment of ghettos and camps in the occupied Soviet Union: in some cases, these ghettos and camps are very obscure and Visual History Archive testimonies may be some of the only sources that confirm their existence. The partisan movement: the archive has a large body of information on a great number of resistance groups (including Jewish partisans units), the individuals connected to them, their operations, structure, organization, rules, and so on. Soviet POWs: the archive contains a number of interviews of Soviet-Jewish prisoners of war who hid their Jewish identity to survive. Ostarbeiter: the archive contains a number of interviews of Soviet-Jewish civilians who concealed their Jewish identity and were deported to Germany with other Ukrainians, Poles, Belorussians, and Russians. Transnistria: the archive has around 3,500 testimonies that relate to Transnistria\u2014the area of southwestern Ukraine between the rivers Dniester and Bug that was under Romanian control between 1941 and 1944. Subjects discussed include the deportation of Jews from Bessarabia and Bukovina to Transnistria; the establishment of ghettos, camps and colonies; conditions under the Romanians; relations between the local Jews and the deportees; and the operation to rescue Jewish orphans from Transnistria organized by the Jewish communities in Bucharest and Palestine.

            "box_content": "What is the USC Shoah Foundation? See About Us . Between April 1994 and December 2005, the organization bore the name Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. Between January 2005 and July 2012, it was known as the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. As of August 2012, the full official name is USC Shoah Foundation \u2013 The Institute for Visual History and Education. What is the Visual History Archive? The Visual History Archive (VHA) is the search tool that allows users to search and browse the entire collection of audiovisual testimonies collected by the USC Shoah Foundation and other partnering organizations. It is based here at USC. See About the VHA . How does the VHA work? Please consult the VHA Help Page . Is the VHA on the internet? On the public internet, desktop computers and mobile devices can search the entire Visual History Archive and view around 4,000 video testimonies . The full VHA, containing 55,000 testimonies, is accessible only at subscribing educational and research institutions: locations worldwide . I am a USC student (staff/faculty member). How can I watch a testimony? See Search the VHA . I am not a USC student (staff/faculty member). How can I watch a testimony? See Search the VHA . How can I get a copy of a testimony? See VHA Copies & Downloads . How many interviews are there in the VHA? Almost 55,000. In total, the VHA contains over 13 years of continuous video. When were the interviews in the VHA recorded? Anti-Rohingya Mass Violence (August-October 2017): 2018 Armenian Genocide: 1970-2017 Cambodian Genocide: 2009-2015 Central African Republic Conflict: 2016 Contemporary Antisemitism: 2015-2019 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda: 2004-2021 Guatemalan Genocide: 2015-2019 Holocaust: 1981-2021 Nanjing Massacres: 2012-2017 South Sudan Civil War: 2015 Where were they recorded? In 62 different countries. See Collecting Testimonies . Did you only interview in English? No, we have recorded interviews in 41 different languages. English is the largest language, with over 27,700 interviews. All Kinyarwanda and Mandarin-language testimonies have English subtitles, although other languages do not. See Collecting Testimonies . Did you only interview Jewish Holocaust survivors? While the experiences of Jewish survivors make up 95% of the total, the Holocaust/World War II interviews also include 10 other interviewee experience groups (homosexual survivors, Jehovah's Witnesses, liberators and liberation witnesses, miscellaneous, non-Jewish forced laborers, political prisoners, rescue and aid providers, Roma survivors, survivor of eugenics policies, war crimes trials participants). The Armenian Genocide interviews contain the experiences of Armenian Survivors, descendants, scholars, foreign Witness, Yezidi survivors, and miscellaneous. The 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda testimonies are made up of Tutsi survivors, rescuers, elders, Hutu Power opponents, and victims' spouses. The Guatemalan Genocide and Nanjing Massacres testimonies are all with survivors. The Central African Republic conflict witnesses were interviewed as delegates to a peace conference in Kigali in 2016. The interviewees in the Contemporary Antisemitism testimonies discuss how the 2015 Copenhagen shootings, especially the attack on the Great Synagogue, has affected their own lives, those of the Danish Jewish community, and Danish society at large. How does the USC Shoah Foundation define the term \u201csurvivor\u201d? In terms of the Holocaust, the USC Shoah Foundation refers to survivors as anyone who suffered and survived persecution for racial, religious, sexual, physical, or political reasons while under Nazi or Axis control between 1933 and May 8, 1945; or who was forced to live clandestinely; or to flee Nazi or Axis onslaught during the war in order to avoid imminent persecution. A person is a survivor if he/she was alive at the point of liberation and/or on May 8, 1945. A person is a survivor if he/she died before May 8, 1945, but successfully fled from German or Axis countries. In terms of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, the USC Shoah Foundation refers to Tutsi survivors as anyone who suffered and survived persecution as Tutsis in Rwanda between April 7 and July 19, 1994. This includes individuals who were of Tutsi descent or were perceived to be of Tutsi descent. How were the interviews conducted? See Collecting Testimonies . How is the archive preserved? See Preserving the Archive . Do you have transcripts for the testimonies? Currently, transcripts are available in the VHA for over 3,700 English-language and for 896 German-language testimonies (NB: German-language transcripts, not translations). The transcripts can only be viewed in the subscription version of the VHA. Indexing is available for all testimonies. How did you index the testimonies? The USC Shoah Foundation created proprietary software for indexing. We devised indexing terms to meet the needs of the collection\u2019s content and organized them into a Thesaurus conforming to standard practice. The Thesaurus evolved over time and grew in volume as the testimonies were indexed. It currently contains more than 60,000 terms, around 90% of which are geographic. Each testimony is indexed in two ways. Biographical profile indexing refers to the data-entry of the pre-interview questionnaires (PIQs) and/or other paperwork accompanying the audiovisual testimony. Video indexing refers to the minute-by-minute indexing of the video interviews. To do this, each interview was divided into one-minute segments\u00a0 Then, indexers assigned terms for times, places, people, and experiences directly to digital time codes within testimonies where those topics were discussed - in a similar way to book index entries that specify the page numbers where topics are covered. For more details, see Indexing . Are there other places that have interviewed Holocaust survivors? Yes, many of them. Please see the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's International Database of Oral History Testimonies . Is the USC Shoah Foundation still collecting interviews? Yes, the USC Shoah Foundation continues to conduct a small number of interviews with Holocaust witnesses. See the Last Chance Testimony Initiative .

Thesis research adds original argument and places images in a different context from the original, typically aesthetic, aim of the copyright owner of the image.\u00a0 Inclusion of an image in a thesis frequently benefits the creator of that image and the creator of any work depicted in the image.\u00a0 The VRA suggests that researchers are best positioned to assert fair use if: Significant commentary, or other original content, accompanies images included in the thesis; Conversely, images included in a thesis are subject of commentary or illustrate a scholarly argument, and are not included for purely aesthetic purposes; Images are incorporated at a size/resolution necessary to make the best scholarly argument; Attributions are provided to the copyright owner of the image, where known; The circulation and distribution of the thesis through online websites or repositories is consistent with academic practices or requirements set forth by the degree-granting institution. Additional Selected Resources on Copyright and Fair Use: The Visual Resources Association (VRA) provides resources\u00a0on intellectual property rights for academic use of images; Columbia University Libraries have a very handy Fair Use Checklist ; Stanford University libraries maintain a web site on copyright and fair use ; The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) has an excellent info-graphic on the myths and facts of Fair Use (February 2017); its resources on fair use include toolkits and other topical infographics. The Harvard University Office of Scholarly Communication published a clear info-graphic on Fair Use in 2017. While geared toward the Harvard University community, its information is clear and accessible; The Association of American Presses has developed an author responsibilities and guidelines FAQ ; Last but not least, the American Library Association's Office of Information Technology Policy has a Copyright Advisory Network which provides links to such resources as Fair Use Evaluator, Public Domain Slider, etc."
